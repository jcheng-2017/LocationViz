Thousands of demonstrators have marched through London to protest the war in Iraq and demand the withdrawal of British troops from that country . Families of soldiers killed in the conflict joined the protesters who carried banners with such slogans as " Bush Number One Terrorist " and " Stop the Bombings . " They marched from the Houses of Parliament to a rally in Hyde Park . Police put the number of marchers at 10000 while organizers claimed it was 1,00,000 . The protest comes on the eve of the annual conference of Britain 's ruling Labor Party in the southern English seaside resort of Brighton . The party is divided over Britain 's participation in the Iraq conflict and the continued deployment of 8500 British troops in that country . The London march came ahead of anti-war protests today in other cities , including Rome , Paris , and Madrid . The International Atomic Energy Agency is to hold second day of talks in Vienna Wednesday on how to respond to Iran 's resumption of low-level uranium conversion . Iran this week restarted parts of the conversion process at its Isfahan nuclear plant . Iranian officials say they expect to get access to sealed sensitive parts of the plant Wednesday , after an IAEA surveillance system begins functioning . The step will allow the facility to operate at full capacity . The European Union , with U.S. backing , has threatened to refer Iran to the U.N. Security Council , which could impose sanctions if it finds Tehran has violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty . Iran 's new President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Tuesday that European incentives aimed at persuading Iran to end its nuclear fuel program are an insult to the Iranian nation . Two Germans and four Nigerian oil workers were kidnapped by armed militants during a raid on a boat in Nigeria 's southern oil-rich Delta region . An official with the German firm Bilfinger Berger , Thomas Horbach , said the gunmen stopped the supply boat Wednesday as it sailed from Delta State to Bayelsa State to inspect an offshore oil field owned by Royal-Dutch Shell . The German firm works as a sub-contractor for Shell . Militant groups frequently attack oil operations in the Niger Delta to demand social services and better job opportunities from multinational companies . Poor residents often complain they have been cheated out of the huge riches extracted from their tribal lands - where the bulk of Nigeria 's 2.3 million barrels of petroleum are pumped daily . Suspected Islamist rebels have fired mortar shells at the palace used by Somalia 's interim President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmad . It was not immediately clear if the president was in the palace in Mogadishu when the attack occurred or if anyone was hurt . Local news reports said at least five mortar shells hit the palace compound and other mortars were fired elsewhere in Mogadishu Wednesday . The attacks occurred after the government said it will go ahead with a reconciliation conference to which more than 1300 Somali elders , warlords and politicians are invited . Iraqi military officials say tanks and troops have arrived in the northern city Mosul for a new offensive against al Qaida in Iraq fighters . Officials will not say how many troops have arrived in the Sunni Arab and Kurdish city , where bombings last week killed at least 34 people and wounded more than 200 . U.S. commanders have not explained how American forces will participate in the offensive . Officials say al Qaida in Iraq fighters have fled successful campaigns against them in Anbar province and Baghdad to other northern provinces . Mosul is the largest city north of Baghdad and has long been a stronghold of Sunni militant fighters . In other violence , U.S. officials said one American soldier was killed while on patrol in Baghdad Sunday . Egyptian police have arrested at least 16 members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood as parts of the country prepare for parliamentary runoff elections Saturday . The arrests occurred Friday in Alexandria . A spokesman for the Brotherhood said the arrests are an attempt to cut the Brotherhood off from its supporters and punishment for winning parliamentary seats in earlier elections . The Muslim Brotherhood has tripled its strength in parliament in recent elections , raising the party 's total to 47 seats . In Saturday 's elections , voters will cast ballots in nine provinces where no candidate won a majority in the previous round of voting . The Muslim Brotherhood is banned as a political party , but it endorses so-called independent candidates whose allegiance to the party is known to voters . Hardline lawmakers in Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province have pushed through a law that aims to ensure " Islamic correctness " in public places and establishes a morality police to enforce decent behavior . A six-party coalition of religious based parties , the Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal , dominates the provincial assembly , so the bill was easily passed Thursday by a vote of 68-34 . The provincial governor must still sign the bill before it becomes law , a step seen only as a formality . The proposed law calls for setting up a " religious police force " to make sure people adhere to Islamic values in public places , and entertainment outlets close during weekly Friday prayers . Violators could be jailed for up to six months . The opposition has denounced the measure , comparing it to the draconian rule of the former Taleban in neighboring Afghanistan . British police say they have arrested a man who dressed as suicide bomber at a demonstration against the publication of cartoons depicting Islam 's Prophet Muhammad . Bedfordshire police said Tuesday that Omar Khayam was arrested in Bedford for breaching the conditions of his parole . Police said the British Home Office sought an investigation of Khayam 's behavior after he was photographed last week at a demonstration dressed in fatigues , a black cap , and a bulky belt . A Home Office spokesman told the Associated Press that if the behavior of a paroled offender gives cause for concern , he can be sent back to prison . The AP also reports Khayam has been on parole from prison since last year after serving half his six-year sentence for drug dealing . Pakistani officials say unidentified gunmen have killed three people , including a former government minister , in a semi-autonomous tribal region bordering Afghanistan . The officials say prominent tribal leader Malik Faridullah Khan was traveling in South Waziristan Sunday when his vehicle was ambushed in the Kani Wam area . His driver and a tribal elder were also killed . No one has claimed responsibility for the killings . The ambush came a day after a commander of Pakistani troops said the army has almost completely eliminated militants in South Waziristan . The area became a refuge for many al-Qaida and Taleban fighters after the Taleban government was ousted in Afghanistan in 2001 . A senior Pakistani military official says Pakistan wants to put what he calls the " sordid chapter " of proliferation by one of its top scientists behind it and build civilian nuclear ties with the United States . But he says Pakistan is not ready to make the nuclear scientist , Abdul Qadeer Khan , available for direct questioning over his sale of nuclear parts and secrets to states including Iran , Libya and North Korea . He said there are reasons of national sensitivities for not making him available . The Pakistani official was giving a background briefing to a small group of reporters in Washington . Khan admitted in 2004 that he operated a worldwide clandestine network to sell nuclear technology in the black market . He was placed under house arrest in Islamabad , but not jailed because he is considered the father of Pakistan 's nuclear bomb . U.S. Army officials said Wednesday that they will not renew a controversial multi-billion dollar contract with the Halliburton company to provide logistical support to U.S. troops in Iraq and elsewhere . Halliburton has been providing a long list of services , from meals to communication , for the military for several years . Critics of Halliburton include auditors and congressional Democrats . They say the company has produced some shoddy work and charges too much money . The company strongly denies the allegations . When the huge contract is put out for re-bidding , several companies will get a chance to compete for portions of the work . Representatives from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council are holding meetings this week to finalize their annual report for APEC leaders who will hold a summit on September 8 and 9 . VOA 's Nancy-Amelia Collins reports from Sydney . Energy , security , climate change , the World Trade Organization 's stalled negotiations , and investment are all expected to be among the major topics in the annual report of the APEC Business Advisory Council , known as ABAC . Tim Harcourt , the chief economist of the Australian Trade Commission , says ABAC plays an important role by informing governments where there are problems . " The most important thing the business groups can do is to tell the governments where there are logjams , where there are obstacles , where things can improve , " Harcourt said . " I think actually ABAC has played a pretty good leadership on that in talking about trade facilitation and basically making sure standards are consistent and harmonious across the region . " ABAC comprises up to three members of the private sector of each of the 21 economies that make up APEC . It meets three times a year . It was made a permanent body in 1995 to provide an independent business perspective within APEC . Members represent a range of business sectors , including medium and small businesses . ABAC says there is a need for businesses to improve energy efficiency and to encourage conservation practices , and is expected to include this in its annual report . Harcourt , of the Australian Trade Commission , says the ABAC report will also discuss ways to enhance regional cooperation . " I reckon they 'll talk a little bit about customs and quarantine , a little bit about having consistent security arrangements around the region , " Harcourt said . " And I think they 'll want a one-stop shop in terms of combining security , immigration , customs , and quarantine together … just to make sure it 's more streamlined and provides more certainty . " ABAC is the only non-governmental body that has an official role and formal dialogue with the leaders of the APEC economies . It will present its annual report at the APEC leaders meeting on Saturday . Sudan 's government says it will order troops to end attacks immediately in Darfur , and is asking rebels to do the same . Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail says Sudanese troops will also withdraw to positions held before an April cease-fire , if rebels in the western region agree to stop attacks . Mr. Ismail announced the decision after meeting with officials from the United Nations and African Union in Khartoum Sunday . In recent weeks , AU officials say Sudanese troops and rebels have repeatedly violated the April truce . Saturday , the head of AU forces in Darfur accused Sudanese government helicopters of bombing rebel sites in the South Darfur village of Labado . Khartoum says troops were defending their positions from rebel attacks . Aid workers say some relief efforts have been suspended in South Darfur due to recent attacks . Indonesian police have arrested three men in connection with the October 1 Bali bombings that left 23 people dead . Indonesian police said Wednesday the men were flown to Bali from neighboring Java island for questioning at Bali police headquarters . Australian and French news agencies say at least one of the men arrested ( Cholily ) was captured during a series of counter-terrorism raids last week in Indonesia . The raids ended with the death of alleged extremist bombmaker Azahari bin Husin . Indonesian authorities blame Azahari bin Husin for orchestrating last month 's attacks in Bali as well as the 2002 Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people . Gunmen have shot and killed a Roman Catholic nun and her bodyguard at the hospital where she worked in Islamist-controlled Mogadishu , Somalia . Some witnesses to the Sunday shooting said they feared the attack was linked to Muslim anger toward Pope Benedict . Two men with pistols attacked the nun , Sister Leonella Sgorbati , after she finished teaching a medical school class at the hospital in southern Mogadishu . Officials say one suspect was arrested . In Rome , a Vatican spokesman deplored the attack and said he hoped it was an isolated event , and not irrationality arising from comments made by the Pope which angered some Muslims . Authorities in Mogadishu have not determined a motive for the shooting . The pope has said he meant no offense to Muslims when he quoted a 14 century Byzantine emperor as saying some teachings of the Prophet Muhammed brought evil to the world . Pakistani forces have targeted militants in the northwest for a third day , launching airstrikes that they say killed at least nine suspected insurgents . Helicopter gunships Saturday pounded militant hideouts in the Orakzai tribal region , where many Taliban militants are believed to have fled to avoid an earlier military offensive in nearby South Waziristan . The Pakistani military launched its offensive in Orakzai to hunt Taliban insurgents . So far , nearly 100 militants have been reported killed in the region since Thursday . On Friday , five soldiers were killed when dozens of militants stormed a military checkpoint in Orakzai . At least 32 suspected militants were killed when troops launched a counter-attack . Elsewhere in the northwest , authorities on Saturday found the bodies of six people who had been shot dead in the Kurram region along the Afghan border . The six were kidnapped a few days ago . The U.S. military in Afghanistan says coalition forces killed 14 Taleban militants in separate clashes this week . The military said Saturday 13 guerrillas were killed in two encounters in the central province of Uruzgan . One Afghan soldier was killed and four others , including a U.S. soldier , were injured in the fighting . Another militant was killed by U.S. troops in eastern Paktika province . Separately , officials say four British soldiers from the NATO-led peacekeeping mission were wounded early Saturday in an attack in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif . It was not immediately clear what motivated the attack . Taleban rebels are not known to operate in northern Afghanistan and the area has been spared much of the bloodshed that has plagued southern and eastern regions . Russian officials say at least five more people have died from a wave of extremely cold weather gripping the nation , bringing the death toll to 43 in the past week . Emergency medical officials say the five victims died in Moscow from exposure , and another 19 people are hospitalized with hypothermia . Russia 's Itar-Tass news agency quotes a medical official as saying some of the victims were intoxicated or homeless . The unusually cold weather is affecting Russia , the Baltic states of Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia , and is moving into the Nordic countries . The death toll is expected to rise as temperatures continue to hover around minus 30 degrees Celsius or lower overnight . Emergency power rationing has been put into effect around Moscow . Health officials in Vietnam say a deadly strain of the bird flu virus has killed a second Vietnamese man this week , raising the country 's death toll from the virus to 50 . Officials say the 27-year old man from Vietnam 's northern Ninh Binh province died late Thursday and tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu . Officials say the man fell ill after slaughtering two chickens at his home . He is the third person to die from avian influenza in Vietnam this year . Not counting the latest death , the World Health Organization says 227 people around the world have died from bird flu since 2003 . Most of the world 's cases , 103 , have occurred in Indonesia . Witnesses in Somalia say insurgents have burned and dragged the bodies of at least two soldiers through the streets of Mogadishu , after a clash between militants and Ethiopian forces killed seven people . The violence erupted Wednesday after insurgents attacked Ethiopian tanks rolling through an insurgent stronghold near the headquarters of the former Defense Ministry in southern Mogadishu . Witnesses say the Ethiopian troops returned heavy fire and that several people were wounded in the fighting . Ethiopia deployed soldiers to Somalia last December to help the interim government push an Islamist movement from power . Somalia 's internationally-recognized government has since been struggling to contain regular outbursts of violence by fighters loyal to the fallen Islamist movement . The African Union has deployed troops to Somalia to replace the Ethiopian forces , which Addis Ababa plans to withdraw . Top Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia says Israeli and Palestinian mediators have agreed to prepare a document outlining their progress toward a peace accord . In remarks to reporters , Qureia said the two sides agreed during recent meetings to begin writing out their positions on all issues discussed during peace negotiations . He did not elaborate on why negotiators had come to the decision . Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas resumed U.S.-brokered peace talks last November , but progress has been slow . The two sides have expressed hope at reaching a peace deal before U.S. President George Bush leaves office early next year . But Qureia said Wednesday that reaching a peace agreement with Israel before Mr. Bush leaves office will take a " miracle . " He told reporters in the West Bank that there is still room for progress in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations . The Israeli military says Major General Udi Adam - the head of the army 's Northern Command - has announced his resignation . A military statement Wednesday , said General Adam has asked to leave his post " as soon as possible , " and the chief of staff has accepted the request to begin the process of his replacement . Adam was widely expected to leave the army after he was pushed aside near the end of the 34-day war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon . He was replaced by another general as " coordinator of operations in Lebanon . " Israeli media say Adam had several disagreements with the army chief , Lieutenant General Dan Halutz , over the conduct of the war . A Washington-based research institute says Pakistan is building a nuclear reactor that could produce enough plutonium for 40 to 50 nuclear weapons a year . The Institute for Science and International Security reports that satellite photos show a possible construction site for a larger nuclear reactor near the small one in the Khushab district of Punjab province . The report says such a reactor could produce over 200 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium , good for 40 to 50 nuclear weapons a year . According to some media reports , Pakistan is now capable of producing plutonium for just two warheads a year . Pakistan 's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam declined to say whether a new reactor is being constructed , but she said the presence of a nuclear weapons program and facilities at Khushab are well known . The American Diabetes Association reports the disease is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults . It is the leading cause of kidney failure . The rate of amputation is 10 times higher among those who suffer from the disease . Experts say those who learn how to manage the disease early , can live healthier and more normal lives . VOA 's June Soh found camps that provide children with this chronic disease a positive approach to living with diabetes while letting them just be kids . Amy Katz Narrates . Cuba and Panama have said they will restore consular relations , months after Havana broke ties with Panama City for pardoning four men convicted in connection with an assassination attempt against Cuban President Fidel Castro . The countries agreed to reopen their consulates , following a meeting Friday between Panamanian President Martin Torrijos and Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage . The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Ibero-American Summit in San Jose , Costa Rica , where heads of state were meeting to discuss a candidate to head the Organization of American States and other regional issues . Cuba severed ties with Panama in August , hours after Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso , in her final days in office , pardoned the men , preventing their extradition to Cuba . They were convicted of plotting to kill Mr. Castro during the 2000 Ibero-American summit in Panama City . The Israeli army has killed a Palestinian youth in the northern Gaza Strip and wounded at least three other people . The army says it targeted a man who was collecting a rocket launcher from an area used to fire rockets at Israel recently . Palestinian medical sources say the Israeli strike killed a teenager . The Israeli military began an offensive in Gaza after militants kidnapped an Israeli soldier in June . More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the offensive . On Sunday , Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh said his Hamas-led government will not recognize Israel . He said an Arab peace plan for the region is problematic because it requires Palestinians to recognize Israel in exchange for an Israeli pullout from Palestinian territories . He spoke after a week of deadly political infighting between Hamas and the rival Fatah party of President Mahmoud Abbas . U.S. automaker Chrysler has opened a $ 570 million engine plant in northern Mexico . During the ceremonial startup of the Saltillo plant Friday , Mexican President Felipe Calderon said Chrysler 's sixth plant in Mexico will create 700 jobs . Mr. Calderon said Mexico has become a worldwide leader in the auto industry . Chrysler plans to build its new fuel-efficient Pentastar V-6 engine for Chrysler , Dodge , Jeep and Ram vehicles . Mexican officials say the new plant will have the capacity to build 4,40,000 engines per year . A U.S. jury has found that drug maker Merck is not liable for the heart attack suffered by a man taking its painkiller Vioxx . The New Jersey jurists agreed with Merck that job stress and health risks caused the 60-year old postal worker to have a heart attack four years ago . The plaintiff argued Vioxx was responsible . The jury also rejected the man 's claim that Merck failed to properly warn users about the drug 's risks . Merck withdrew the popular drug last year after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart problems in long-term users . Merck is facing thousands of other lawsuits over Vioxx . Thursday 's verdict is only the second in a Vioxx case . In the first , Merck was ordered to pay millions of dollars to the widow of a Vioxx user . Merck is appealing that decision . The rumors are TRUE : Nicole Ritchie is pregnant . Speaking to ABC News interviewer Dianne Sawyer , the 25-year-old co-star of TV 's The Simple Life said she is almost four months along in her pregnancy . She said the father is her boyfriend , Joel Madden of the rock band Good Charlotte . Ritchie also spoke about her guilty plea last week to driving under the influence and the resulting four-day jail sentence . " I have a responsibility and it 's something that I did wrong , and if I could personally apologize to every single person that has lost a loved one from drunk driving , I would , " she said . " And unfortunately I ca n't , but this is my way of paying my dues and taking responsibility and being an adult . " The interview airs August 2 and 3 on Good Morning America , and later August 3 on 20/20 . U.S. Senator John Warner of the southeastern state of Virginia , a prominent Republican figure in the debate over the war in Iraq , says he will retire after finishing his term in 2009 . Warner told supporters outside of the University of Virginia Friday that he will not seek a sixth term in the 2008 elections . The former chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee has openly criticized President Bush 's handling of the war in Iraq . He called on Mr. Bush earlier this month to begin withdrawing some U.S. troops from Iraq . His retirement will leave open what would have been a relatively safe seat for Republicans in the fight for Senate control in the elections . Democrats will now have a better chance to protect or expand their one-seat majority in the Senate . When he leaves office , the 80-year-old former Navy secretary will have served 30 years as a U.S. senator . The United Nations says December 's Indian Ocean tsunami caused around $ 520 million in damage to fishing industries in seven of the worst hit countries . The U.N. 's Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) said the tsunami destroyed or damaged more than 1,11,000 fishing vessels in the region . It said the loss was significant in a region where fishing provides a vital source of food . The FAO 's estimate includes damage to fishing industries in Indonesia , Maldives , Somalia , Sri Lanka and Thailand . The agency says it has sent experts to help rebuild fishing industry infrastructure lost in the disaster and is developing strategies for long-term recovery in the region . Officials in Indonesia say another person has died from bird flu , bringing the country 's death toll from the disease to 96 since the outbreak started in 2003 . The latest victim was a 16-year-old girl from the town of Bekasi , on the eastern outskirts of Jakarta . Officials say she died Tuesday . Monday , officials reported that a 32-year-old woman from an area just west of Jakarta died of bird flu last week , at her home in the city of Tangerang . A statement from the health ministry said the woman 's family kept chickens in their backyard . Humans are usually infected with bird flu by direct contact with infected poultry , but experts fear the H5N1 virus may mutate into a form easily transmitted between people . Scientists fear such a mutation could spark a global pandemic with a potential death toll of millions . Thailand says it has photo evidence to prove its claim that Islamic militants responsible for violence in Thailand 's Muslim-majority south are training in neighboring Malaysia . Thai Deputy Interior Minister Sutham Saengprathum says the photos show the militants training in Malaysia 's northern Kelantan state , which borders southern Thailand . He said if Malaysia wants to see the photos , Bangkok will provide them . Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has said he believes some of the insurgents have been trained in Malaysia , Indonesia and southern Thailand . Malaysia and Indonesia have demanded proof of Bangkok 's allegations . More than 500 people have been killed this year in an insurgency that some say is supported by extremist Muslims in Indonesia and Malaysia . Anti-Japanese protests in the western Chinese city of Shanghai turned violent Saturday , with protesters pelting the Japanese consulate with rocks , bottles and eggs . Several thousand people took to the streets of Shanghai as part of a new wave of anti-Japanese protests over Japan 's bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council and Tokyo 's alleged downplaying of war atrocities . In Beijing , police are out in force waiting for protests to begin in the capital . State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan told the official Xinhua news agency that China 's government is urging people to protest in a calm and orderly manner . Japan 's Foreign Minister , Nobutaka Machimura , arrives Sunday in Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart , Li Zhaoxing , to discuss relations between the two countries . Organizers of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London have promised the " greenest games " in history and sought to soothe concerns about the rising cost of the event . With 2012 days to go until the Games get under way , organizers said the design would champion low waste , low carbon emissions and environmentally friendly transportation . The Olympic Delivery Authority has promised to cut emissions 50 percent by generating energy on site and using renewable energy . Prime Minister Tony Blair said London is farther ahead in preparations at this stage than any other previous Olympic host city . The British government wants to have the Olympic budget finalized early this year , but costs have already risen substantially since London won the bid in July of 2005 . A select committee report due Wednesday is expected to be highly critical of the government 's financing of the Games . China 's giant pandas have been on endangered species lists for nearly 30 years . There are only about 1600 pandas still living in the wild in China . One of the 2008 Olympic mascots is modeled on a panda called Jing Jing . Conservationists hope she will help draw attention to the threats facing the giant panda -- one of China 's national symbols . Sam Beattie reports from Jing Jing 's home in Sichuan province . British defense officials say 14 British military personnel have been killed in a crash of a NATO aircraft in southern Afghanistan . A NATO spokesman says the aircraft went off the radar and crashed in an open area near Kandahar Saturday . Officials say the aircraft was supporting a NATO mission in the country 's south , but there is no indication of enemy action causing the crash . The crash comes as NATO forces launched an offensive to drive Taleban remnants out of Kandahar . Officials say " Operation Medusa " is aimed at removing the Taleban threat so that stability , reconstruction and development can be achieved in the area . Sri Lankan authorities say a prominent Tamil journalist was found shot dead Friday in Colombo , hours after he was abducted by several attackers as he left a restaurant . Dharmeratnam Sivaram was a board member of the pro-rebel TamilNet Web site and a columnist for Sri Lanka 's english newspaper , the Daily Mirror . Mr. Sivaram 's Web site became popular for ongoing reports on the Sri Lankan civil war and was a prominent supporter of the Tamil Tiger rebel movement . Mr. Sivaram , who was also brutally attacked in 2001 , was found near a lake gagged with gunshot wounds to the head . No one claimed responsibility for the killing . Japan and North Korea say they are considering a resumption of bilateral talks as part of efforts to normalize relations . Japanese media reported Monday that the two countries hope to arrange to hold the talks in Beijing in early November . The talks could come before six-party talks on North Korea 's nuclear ambitions resume . Japan and North Korea have not had formal bilateral talks for about a year . Tokyo and Pyongyang are at odds over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program and the North 's kidnapping of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s . A human rights group has accused coalition forces in Iraq of failing to secure evidence considered vital to the upcoming war crimes trial of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . Human Rights Watch , in a report released Thursday , said coalition forces failed to stop people from stealing thousands of Iraqi government documents in the months after the 2003 invasion of Iraq . The group also accused troops of failing to stop people from damaging several mass graves in the war-torn country . The Associated Press quotes a U.S. Defense Department spokeswoman as saying it has not reviewed the report . Saddam Hussein was arraigned in July at a U.S. military base on the outskirts of Baghdad . He faces charges of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity . Egypt 's government and the World Health Organization say three Egyptian children have been hospitalized with the deadly form of avian flu . The children come from different parts of the country . WHO says they are receiving treatment and are in stable condition . The organization says the children had a history of contact with dead birds . Thirty two Egyptians have contracted the H5N1 form of avian flu . Thirteen of them have died . Egypt has had the largest number of human bird flu cases outside of Asia . The head of the U.N. investigation into the Iraq oil-for-food program says Saddam Hussein illegally obtained more money from oil smuggling than from corruption in the U.N. program . Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker says the smuggling began before the start of the oil-for-food program , and was known to the United Nations Security Council . In an interview with the U.S. government-funded alHurra television station , Mr. Volcker said there is a lot of confusion about how much money Saddam obtained from the oil-for-food program itself . He refused to provide specific estimates , but said large amounts that have been reported in the media were from smuggling and not from funds diverted from the program . The United Nations created the oil-for-food program after the first Gulf War to allow Iraq to sell oil and use the profits for the Iraqi people 's humanitarian needs . Kyrgyzstan 's Justice Ministry says four people , including parliament member Tynychbek Akmatbayev , have been killed at a prison near Bishkek after inmates took them hostage . Interior Minister Murat Sutalinov is at the prison to head negotiations with the inmates . The ministry gave no other details . It is not clear if the hostage-takers made any demands . Mr. Akmatbayev was involved in negotiations on Wednesday at another Kyrgyz prison where a riot over poor living conditions forced the staff to evacuate earlier this week . That prison , also near Bishkek , remained surrounded by security forces on Thursday . A commercial airplane taking off from Western Europe has landed in Iraq for the first time in nearly 20 years . The plane , operated by France 's Aigle Azur airline , took off from Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris late Saturday and touched down at Baghdad International Airport early Sunday . Officials said this first flight was largely ceremonial , and that most of the passengers were French diplomats and business leaders . One of the passengers , French Foreign Trade Minister Anne-Marie Idrac , called it a historic day for cooperation between France and Iraq . Regular service between Paris and Baghdad is not expected to start for at least several weeks . Aigle Azur is just one of a number of airlines to start flying to Baghdad . Etihad and Emirates airlines , both operating out of the United Arab Emirates , started flying to Baghdad earlier this year . A new government report shows U.S. businesses added a moderate 1,11,000 new jobs in January . The Labor Department Friday issued a report that also showed the U.S. unemployment rate increased for the first time in three months - to 4.6 percent . According to the report , American workers earned an average of $ 17.09 an hour in January - a slight increase from the previous month . Analysts say the Department of Labor report will help ease worries that a tight labor market will significantly inflate wages and costs . Earlier this week , the U.S. central bank decided to maintain a key interest rate , despite the risk of inflation . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has denounced Colombia 's defense minister as an obstacle to peace and a pawn of the United States . Mr. Chavez reacted sharply Sunday to the defense minister 's remarks about a meeting between Mr. Chavez and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe . The two presidents met Friday to try to mend ties between their countries . After the meeting , Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said he hoped Venezuela would follow through with promises made during the meeting . During a televised speech Sunday , Mr. Chavez called on President Uribe to put his defense minister in his place . Tensions between the two countries rose in March when Colombia attacked a rebel camp in Ecuador . Venezuela responded by sending troops to the Colombian border . China has lashed out at a U.S. report critical of Chinese policies on religious freedom , saying such criticism could harm U.S. - China relations . In its annual report issued Wednesday , the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said China continues to be responsible for pervasive and severe violations of religious freedom , regularly imprisoning and harassing religious leaders and practitioners . In a statement Saturday Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao accused the U.S. body of attempting to interfere with Chinese internal affairs under the guise of religious freedom . He said such criticism runs counter to the good development of U.S - China relations . Liu said China protects the religious freedom of Chinese citizens according to law , and that citizens enjoy full freedom of religion . China 's communist government allows worship only in state-approved and state-monitored churches , temples and mosques . People who worship in unauthorized ways are subject to arrest . President Bush has issued 14 pardons to convicted criminals , and has commuted the prison sentences of two others . The pardons , announced Monday , include no high-profile names . They were for people convicted of such acts as bank embezzlement , making FALSE statements to the federal government , unlawfully killing wildlife , and committing drug offenses . Including Monday 's actions , Mr. Bush has granted 171 pardons and commuted eight sentences while U.S. president . Pardons are one of the president 's absolute powers , and in recent years it has become typical for the president to issue pardons as he prepares to leave office . White House officials say he made the pardon decisions on a case-by-case basis , and will continue to review clemency requests . Uganda 's government and rebels of the Lord 's Resistance Army are nearing a peace deal to end more than 20 years of conflict . Officials close to the negotiations say an accord signed Friday provides for the disarmament and demobilization of the LRA . The two sides signed a permanent cease-fire agreement last Saturday during peace talks in Sudan . However , there is still uncertainty the rebels will sign the final peace deal until rebel leader Joseph Kony is granted immunity from international prosecution . Kony is one of five LRA officials sought by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes . LRA fighters are accused of murdering thousands of civilians and raping and mutilating others during the long insurgency in northern Uganda . World number one men 's tennis player Roger Federer has been nearly unbeatable in the past year . But his warmup for the Australian Open has abruptly ended with a rare loss . The Swiss star was upset Wednesday by German Tommy Haas in the opening match of the Kooyong Classic in Melbourne . Because he was playing in exhibition tournament , the loss will not count on his Association of Tennis Professionals Tour record . The 41st ranked Haas fended off three break points while serving for the match and closed a 42889 , 42831 , 42831 win with an ace . Federer said he is completely healthy and has no concerns that the ankle problem that curtailed his last season would flare up before the Australian Open , which starts Monday . The European Space Agency says it has received the first images and scientific readings from the surface of Saturn 's moon Titan . Officials at agency headquarters in Germany Friday say information taken from the Huygens space probe show what looks like drainage channels on the moon . They say the surface has canyons that were most likely caused by some type of liquid . The space probe began transmitting data to the Cassini spacecraft while landing on Saturn 's largest moon earlier Friday . Scientists say the information from Huygens - operated jointly by the American , European and Italian space agencies - may provide clues about how primitive Earth evolved into a life-bearing planet . Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye has been released on bail , after a judge ruled his detention by the military was illegal . Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of Dr. Besigye 's supporters who took to the streets in Kampala after his release Monday . Uganda 's military had detained Dr. Besigye since November , when he returned from self-imposed exile to run against President Yoweri Museveni in next month 's presidential election . A military tribunal has charged Dr. Besigye with terrorism and possessing illegal weapons . But a Ugandan High Court Judge , John Bosco Katutsi , said his detention was illegal because the High Court had suspended the military trial . Dr. Besigye still faces rape charges , for which a civilian trial began Monday . He has denied all the charges , which supporters say were trumped up to keep him from running for president . U.S. President Barack Obama says improvements in the American health care system are inevitable . Mr. Obama made his comments in the White House Rose Garden Monday as he nominated an African-American woman , Regina Benjamin , to become the U.S. Surgeon General . The president said " naysayers and cynics " should not bet against the passage of health insurance legislation . He also said inaction on the issue is not an option . Mr. Obama has vowed to sign a health care bill into law this year . Democrats in the House of Representatives say they are nearly ready to unveil their health care reform plan . Controversy over extending health coverage to uninsured Americans centers on how to pay for it . It is expected to cost $ 1 trillion over 10 years . World Bank member nations meeting in Washington have approved a debt relief plan for 17 African and Latin American countries that could total $ 37 billion over 40 years . World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz said two-thirds of the bank members have now approved the plan , meaning the bank could start forgiving debts in July . The move follows July 's pledge from the wealthy G-8 countries to cancel the debt of the world 's poorest countries , many of which are located in Africa . The 17 countries now eligible for World Bank debt relief are Benin , Bolivia , Burkina Faso , Ethiopia , Ghana , Guyana , Honduras , Madagascar , Mali , Mozambique , Nicaragua , Niger , Rwanda , Senegal , Tanzania , Uganda and Zambia . Iran has closed government offices and schools in Tehran for two days because of wind-blown dust that has polluted the capital . Government authorities have declared Tuesday and Wednesday a public holiday , and Iranian media say many domestic airline flights have been canceled . Medical authorities are advising people with heart and respiratory problems to stay inside . Iran 's Press TV says Tehran 's Air Quality Control Company has found the amount of potentially harmful particulate in the air has reached dangerous levels . The dust has blown in from Saudi Arabia and neighboring Iraq , where a severe sandstorm recently blanketed the capital , Baghdad . Sandstorms can be caused by heavy winds blowing across deserts , or across land that has lost its fertile top soil and greenery . Shortly before midnight a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowd of young Israelis waiting to get into a beachfront nightclub in Tel Aviv . Israeli police say the bomber was spotted and prevented from entering the club . They say if he had gotten inside the carnage would have been even worse . It is unclear who was behind the attack with major Palestinian militant groups saying they had nothing to do with it . A statement released by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah vowed to track down and punish those responsible , saying this was an attempt to sabotage the peace process . The bombing shatters weeks of calm after Mr. Abbas declared a truce during a summit with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in Egypt earlier this month . Indonesian officials say they have signed an initial agreement with Russia to build a space launch center on the remote island of Biak off the coast of Papua New Guinea . An Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman says senior officials from both countries reached the preliminary agreement last week . They say the island is well-suited for the project because of its proximity to the equator , which makes it easier to launch satellites into some Earth orbits . The spokesman says a formal agreement on the project will be signed in June when Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is scheduled to visit Moscow . An Algerian man goes on trial Monday in France for terrorist attacks on the Paris subway in 1995 . Prosecutors say Rachid Ramda helped fund at least three bombings on the Paris metro . If he is convicted , Ramda could get life in prison . The 38-year-old is already serving a 10-year sentence in France after he was convicted last year on terrorism charges . Police say Ramda operated from London where investigators say they found evidence that he sent money to terrorists . He is accused of helping fund attacks carried out by an Algerian militant organization the Armed Islamic Group . British police arrested Ramda in 1995 . He fought extradition to France for 10 years . In Monday 's trial , Ramda is facing charges of being an accomplice to at least three bombings on the Paris subway , including the July 25 , 1995 attack that killed eight people and injured more than 150 . The United Nations says Sudanese refugees have begun returning from the Central African Republic under a new deal between the countries and the U.N. refugee agency . The U.N. says the deal , which was signed Wednesday , will allow some 16000 Sudanese refugees living in the CAR to voluntarily return home . It says the first group of refugees was scheduled to fly home Thursday . Five thousand refugees are expected to return to Sudan by April . The rest will go home by the end of the year . The deal is one of several involving Sudan reached this week by the refugee agency and Sudan 's neighbors . The U.N. says the other agreements will allow for the return of 13000 Sudanese refugees living in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and for the return of nearly 7000 Congolese refugees currently in Sudan . Police in Japan say a teacher stabbed to death a 12-year-old girl Saturday in the country 's third killing of a school girl in less than three weeks . Yu Hagino , 23 , was arrested at the murder scene , a school in the western city of Uji . Police say the suspect confessed to stabbing the girl with a knife after arguing with her . The killing follows the recent murders of two school girls in the space of just over a week . The two were killed in separate incidents as they walked home alone from elementary school along deserted roads . Radical Islamic cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed has called on all Muslims to leave Europe . In an interview with French television to be broadcast Monday , Mr. Bakri says Muslims will one day return to Europe , and the Islamic flag will fly over Downing Street , the home of Britain 's prime minister . The interview took place in Beirut where Mr. Bakri lives after the British government stripped him of his residency in its campaign to rein in radical Islamic leaders . Mr. Bakri triggered British outrage after the July 7 bombings in London when he said he would never tip off police if he knew a Muslim was about to carry out an attack . In the France 3 interview , Mr. Bakri says the backgrounds of the four suicide bombers in the London attacks prove the message of al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden has reached moderate communities . Iran 's defense minister has denounced remarks by the top U.S. military commander , who said Washington has not ruled out the use of force against Iran to prevent it from making nuclear weapons . Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen said Sunday that the U.S. has a plan to strike Iran . But Admiral Mullen said he hopes the military option is not needed . Iran 's defense minister , Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi , said Tuesday that U.S. threats to attack his country violate the United Nations charter . He warned that Tehran has drawn up defensive plans that would make its enemies regret any attack . The United States and other Western countries accuse Iran of secretly developing nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian energy program - a charge Iran denies . Admiral Mullen said he hopes the combination of sanctions and diplomatic efforts will resolve the dispute . Georgia 's president has announced plans for his country to get emergency natural gas supplies from Iran to help end the country 's shortage of both gas and electricity . President Mikhail Saakashvili told cabinet members Friday that gas from Iran is expected to begin flowing into Georgia beginning Sunday or , at the latest , Monday . Residents in the former Soviet republic have been enduring freezing weather with limited supplies after explosions on pipelines delivering Russian natural gas . Russian authorities deny Georgian charges that they deliberately cut supplies , and insist the pipelines were sabotaged . Repairs are due to be completed by Sunday . Georgia is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas . President Saakashvili says the agreement with Iran shows his country has alternative sources . Millions of Georgians have also been without electricity because of a breakdown of a unit at a power station , as well as downed power lines . Peru 's former President , Alberto Fujimori , has told authorities he is trying to form a political alliance to support his bid to run in next April 's presidential election . In a visit to the Peruvian consulate in Tokyo Wednesday , Mr. Fujimori had his signature validated on a document joining his Si Cumple party with two other political parties . The consulate said it notarized his signature , but not the contents of the document . The disgraced ex-president and son of Japanese parents fled to Japan in 2000 , where he was granted citizenship . The exiled president is wanted in Peru to face charges of corruption and human rights abuses related to the death squad murders of 25 people . Mr. Fujimori , Peru 's hard-line ruler from 1990 to 2000 , has denied the charges , calling them politically motivated . Tokyo has refused requests from Lima for his extradition . The British Embassy in Sudan 's capital has re-opened to the public , four days after it was closed because of a possible terrorist threat . The embassy said in a statement Thursday that " additional security " has allowed it to resume normal consular and visa services . The statement also thanked the Sudanese government for its cooperation . Earlier this week , the government said it had broken up a plot to attack several Western diplomatic missions in the capital , Khartoum . The state news agency reported that police had arrested eight Sudanese men and confiscated arms and explosives . The British Embassy has advised British citizens to avoid travel to Khartoum . Kenyan police have opened fire at hundreds of people demonstrating against cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad , as protests across the Muslim world showed no signs of abating . At least one Kenyan was wounded Friday when protesters tried to march on the Danish embassy in Nairobi , shouting anti-Denmark slogans and burning Danish flags . Muslims also demonstrated Friday in cities across the Middle East as well as in India , Pakistan , Afghanistan , Bangladesh , Malaysia , and Venezuela . In France , a Muslim organization - the French Council of the Muslim Faith - said it was launching legal action against French newspapers that published the cartoons , one of which depicts the Prophet Muhammad wearing a turban shaped like a bomb . Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told an international conference Friday the Muslim world and the West must stop demonizing each other and " accept one another as equals . " The death toll from a coal mining accident in northwestern China rose to 32 Wednesday after searchers recovered the body of the last missing miner . China 's state-run media say 39 people were working at the privately-owned coal mine in Shaanxi province on Saturday when a gas explosion occurred . Seven miners managed to reach the surface , but the others were trapped . The Xinhua news agency says police have detained the owner and managers of the mine , but provided no other details . Chinese mines are among the most dangerous in the world . Thousands of people are killed every year in explosions , cave-ins and floods , despite government crackdowns on safety violations . India and Pakistan plan to hold a third round of peace talks in January with a focus on security , the Kashmir issue and confidence-building measures between the nuclear rivals . The two-day talks will begin on January 17 and they will be led by the countries ' foreign secretaries . They will review progress made so far and also chart a course for future negotiations . The talks will be under a peace process that the two sides began in January 2004 . A foreign office spokeswoman in Islamabad also said that the two sides have been holding secret talks on possible reduction of forces in Kashmir and a Pakistani proposal of self-rule in Kashmir . She did not give any more details and also declined to reveal at what level the talks are being held . India has not made any comment about the talks . Iraqi officials say at least two people were killed and several others wounded in a car bomb blast in central Baghdad Tuesday . Earlier reports said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber . It came as the U.S. military announced it had rounded up 428 suspects over the past 30 hours in a major operation against insurgents in a western suburb of the capital . On Monday , dozens of people were killed and scores were hurt in a series of car bombings and other attacks in cities and towns across Iraq . Also Monday , an al-Qaida-linked group claimed responsibility for gunning down a top Iraqi security official ( Wael al-Rubaei ) and his driver in Baghdad . Iran 's hard-line Guardian Council has approved a bill that would block United Nations inspections of its nuclear facilities and allow it to resume uranium enrichment if it is referred to the U.N. Security Council . State media report Saturday that the 12-member council approved the measure after deciding it does not contradict the constitution or Islamic law . The parliament already approved the bill last month . The final step will be President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's signature . The move could jeopardize nuclear talks with Europe that Iran said it expects will resume within weeks . Those talks collapsed in August , when Tehran restarted converting uranium - the precursor of enrichment . Last year , Tehran suspended enrichment as a good faith measure to allay international concerns it is secretly pursuing nuclear weapons , a charge its government denies . Zambian officials say reports that President Levy Mwanawasa has died are FALSE . Information Minister Mike Mulongoti made a televised address Thursday to say the foreign media reports are not TRUE . He said President Mwanawasa remains in stable condition in a Paris hospital , and is being treated for hypertension . Mr. Mwanawasa was flown to France Tuesday after suffering a stroke Sunday while in Egypt for an African Union summit . The summit was dominated by the political crisis in Zimbabwe , and the absence of Mr. Mwanawasa , a critic of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe , was said to hurt attempts to put more pressure on Harare . Mr. Mwanawasa is 59 years old and has served as Zambia 's president since 2002 . He is also the current leader of the Southern African Development Community . He suffered a mild stroke two years ago . U.S. President Barack Obama has named Gene Sperling as the new head of the National Economic Council , which oversees the administration 's economic policies . Sperling had the same job in President Bill Clinton 's administration . He succeeds Lawrence Summers , another top economic official from the Clinton-era . Sperling has spent the first two years of the Obama administration as a counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner . Mr. Obama made the announcement Friday during a visit to a window manufacturer located outside of Washington , D.C. Sperling 's appointment is the latest major staff change for the Obama administration as it begins dealing with a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives , and planning for the president 's likely re-election campaign in 2012 . On Thursday , Mr. Obama named another ex-Clinton official , William Daley , as his new chief of staff , replacing Rahm Emmanuel . Authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina say they have arrested a former Bosnian Serb police officer for his suspected role in the 1995 massacre of Muslims near the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica . The state prosecutor 's office says 37-year-old Dragan Neskovic was arrested Wednesday in the northeastern town of Bijeljina on suspicion of genocide . No further details were released . More than 8000 Muslim men and boys were killed by Serb forces in July 1995 in what was supposed to have been a United Nations safe haven . The Srebrenica killings are considered the worst European massacre since World War II . The U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague has already sentenced 14 Serbs for their key roles in the killings . Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is currently on trial there , charged with genocide and crimes against humanity . The Bosnian war crimes court was established in 2005 to ease the workload of the Hague-based tribunal . China 's official Xinhua news agency says archaeologists have discovered the ruins of 29 villages that date back more than 4500 years . The report said the ancient communities were discovered in the northern part of Shaanxi province , a region known for its archaeological treasures . Xinhua says the ruins show that people had mastered building techniques and had constructed houses and stone walls around their community . It said a total of 96 houses were unearthed , as well as the ruins of a sacrificial altar . The report quoted an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological Research Institute as saying the discovery will help scientists better understand the environment during the Neolithic period , also known as the New Stone Age . A United Nations expert on extrajudicial killings says he would like to visit Thailand to investigate last month 's deaths of 87 Muslim protesters . Philip Alston said he is deeply concerned by the October 25 incident . He said a visit to Thailand would allow him to speak with those involved and to recommend ways to bring peace and stability to the region . Thailand has not responded to Mr. Alston 's request . Meanwhile , Thailand 's revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej warned that the country could fall into ruin if the violence in the south does not end . He urged security forces to better cooperate to deal with the region 's turmoil . Hundreds of people have been killed since January when an insurgency flared up in Thailand 's three Muslim-majority southern provinces . Israeli soldiers have killed two Palestinians in the southern Gaza Strip . Witnesses say the two men were killed early Friday near the security barrier separating southern Gaza with Israel . Israeli military officials say troops had spotted the men attempting to plant bombs along the barrier . The killings were the latest in a series of clashes between the Israeli army and Palestinian militants . Israeli soldiers killed five Palestinians Thursday during an army operation in the West Bank city of Nablus . Officials say three of the dead were wanted militants from the al-Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades , a violent offshoot of the mainstream Fatah Party . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and incoming Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh Friday denounced the Israeli military 's sweep through the Nablus refugee camps . The head of U.S. troops in the Horn of Africa says terrorists and insurgents may begin leaving war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and head for east Africa . Major General Timothy Ghormley says officials are concerned that instability and weak governments in east Africa could draw international terrorist groups seeking to establish a base of operations . General Ghormley says the joint task force in Djibouti has been helping to train foreign soldiers and build anti-terrorist capabilities of governments in the region . However , U.S. forces have yet to enter Somalia , which has been without a functioning central government for more than 10 years . Earlier this year , Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi warned an al-Qaida cell is already operating out of Somalia 's capital , Mogadishu . Ugandan Lord 's Resistance Army rebels are seeking a 12-month suspension in the arrest warrants against their leaders issued by the International Criminal Court . James Obita , the technical advisor to the rebels ' negotiating team , tells VOA the rebels will ask for the suspension when peace talks with the Ugandan government resume Thursday in Juba , southern Sudan . He says in connection with that request , the rebels will propose an " alternative justice system " to deal with war crimes committed during the rebels ' 20-year uprising in northern Uganda . LRA fighters are accused of killing and mutilating thousands of civilians during the conflict . The International Criminal Court has indicted five top rebel leaders on war crimes charges . The LRA has demanded those charges be dropped as a condition for signing any peace deal . The 10-month-old peace talks have achieved some progress , including a ceasefire that the sides extended in April . A group linked to al-Qaida in Iraq is denying Iraqi government reports that its leader was recently arrested . The Islamic State of Iraq says the man it claims is its leader , Abu Omar al-Baghdadi , is fine . The group says on an Islamist Web site it does not know the person who Iraqi authorities arrested last month and presented as al-Baghdadi . The Iraqi army said it captured the Sunni insurgent leader in the Iraqi capital , Baghdad . The United States did not confirm the report . Iraqi authorities in the past have announced the arrest or killing of major insurgent leaders , to only later say the reports were FALSE . In addition , U.S. military commander General Kevin Bergner previously had said al-Baghdadi may not be a real person , but rather a fictional character created to put an Iraqi face on the otherwise foreign leadership of al-Qaida in Iraq . U.S. military officials have announced changes to military trials of terrorism suspects being held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Air Force Brigadier General Thomas Hemingway said Wednesday the so-called " improvements " will bring the process closer to the American judge-and-jury system . He said the presiding officer at the trial will function more like a judge than under the previous system , and other officers will act like a jury . Some human rights groups rejected the changes for not going far enough , noting there is still no option for appeal to an independent court . U.S. military officials have filed charges against four detainees at Guantanamo , where more than 500 terror suspects are being held . Meantime Center for Constitutional Rights said some prisoners have launched a hunger strike to protest their conditions . A landmine blast in southern Afghanistan has killed nine Afghan soldiers . The Taleban later claimed responsibility for the blast in Kandahar province . An Afghan Army spokesman said the troops were traveling towards the nearby Pakistani border when their vehicle hit the mine . U.S.-led forces are hunting down remnants of Afghanistan 's ousted Taleban regime who frequently carry out hit and run attacks on coalition and Afghan government forces , mainly in the country 's eastern and southern regions . Four key Palestinian militant groups say they are ending a truce aimed at easing attacks on Israel . In separate statements issued Sunday , Hamas and the Popular Resistance Committees said they were no longer bound by the truce deal brokered last March by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas . The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and Islamic Jihad also scrapped the deal , and said they had fired rockets early today into southern Israel . In a separate development , gunmen in the Gaza Strip stormed a club for United Nations workers and blew up a hall where alcohol was served . There were no reports of injuries and no claim of responsibility . A short while later , gunmen in Gaza kidnapped an Italian activist near Khan Younis , but later released him . Coalition troops in Iraq have captured a suspected al-Qaida terrorist during a raid on the home of a senior Sunni Arab politician , Adnan al-Dulaymi . U.S. officials say they believe the man was involved in planning car bomb attacks on Baghdad 's Green Zone , which houses government , diplomatic and military offices . The man is identified as a bodyguard at Mr. Dulaymi 's home in the Iraqi capital . Officials say the raid does not imply the politician himself is involved in illegal activity . On Friday , Iraqi authorities imposed a curfew in Baghdad , because of fears of new violence . The ban on pedestrians and vehicles was expected to remain in effect until Sunday . In the northern city of Tal Afar , a car bomb exploded Saturday , killing two people and wounding 30 others . The U.S. military says the Iraqi army has captured three suspected al-Qaida in Iraq leaders involved in roadside bomb attacks . Statements Wednesday say the suspects were detained in separate operations north of Baghdad in Kirkuk province , and in the towns of Tarmiyah and Judaidah . The military says U.S. Special Forces advised the Iraqi army in all three operations . The U.S. military also says Iraqi special operations forces detained seven suspected criminals in and around Baghdad 's Sadr City district , a stronghold of radical Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr . U.S. and Iraqi soldiers have been fighting Shi'ite militants in Sadr City in recent weeks as part of a crackdown on illegal militias . The United Nations reports a halt to international aid work in the displaced persons ' camps of Zalinge , in Sudan 's Darfur region . The U.N. refugee agency says international groups suspended their activities in the camps after a mob killed three water workers on Thursday . It was unclear what caused the violence . Friday , spokesman Ron Redmond said agency is " extremely concerned " about what he called the continued deterioration in Darfur 's security situation . Redmond listed a number of attacks on relief groups over the past week , including one where an aid worker was shot dead in North Darfur . World leaders have been pressing Sudan to accept a U.N. peacekeeping force in Darfur . The government is still rejecting any U.N. deployment to the region , where more than three years of violence has killed nearly 2,00,000 people , and displaced some two million others . Iraq 's parliament has approved six new government ministers , including four from the country 's Sunni minority which held power under Saddam Hussein . However , the Sunni Human Rights appointee Hashem Ashibli quickly turned down the post , leaving a single vacancy in the 33-member cabinet . He said he could not accept a position awarded on a sectarian basis . A Sunni Arab , Saadoun al-Dulaimi , has been approved as defense minister , and a Shi'ite ( Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum ) will head the all-important oil ministry . Top slots in the ministries of industry and electricity were also filled , along with a third deputy prime minister position . Meanwhile , Iraqi police say gunmen assassinated a senior member of the Transportation Ministry Zoba Yass and his driver today in Baghdad . Separately , U.S. officials say coalition forces killed six insurgents and captured 54 suspects early Sunday near the western border town of al-Qaim . The U.S. government is delivering more bad news on the country 's struggling economy , saying first time claims for unemployment benefits are at a 26-year high . The Labor Department report , issued Thursday , said the number of laid-off workers applying for benefits for the first time soared to 6,26,000 last week . Officials said the total number of workers receiving unemployment benefits is now close to 4.8 million , another record . A comprehensive government report on unemployment is due out Friday . Economists surveyed by news organizations predict the nationwide jobless rate will rise three-tenths of a percent to hit 7.5 percent . Despite the rising claims for unemployment insurance , U.S. companies are squeezing more productivity out of their shrinking workforces . A second Labor Department report Thursday said productivity - a measure of how much an employee produces per hour - rose more than three percent for the last three months of 2008 . At least 17 people , including seven children , were killed and more than 70 others wounded in an explosion Monday at a home used for religious education in Pakistan 's Punjab province . Officials in the Mian Channu area said they believe the blast , which also flattened more than 20 nearby houses , was caused by a cache of explosives stored in the house . They said the rescuers were trying to recover people still trapped in the rubble . The house belongs to a Muslim cleric who has been accused of recruiting fighters for a banned militant group . It is unclear what triggered the blast , but local police searching through the debris say they found rocket launchers , grenades , and several suicide-bomber jackets . Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani condemned the blast and ordered an inquiry into the incident . A U.S. immigration judge has denied bail for Luis Posada Carriles , an asylum-seeking former CIA operative from Cuba . U.S. authorities arrested the 77-year-old Posada Carriles in May after he illegally entered the country through Mexico . Posada Carriles is wanted in Venezuela for his alleged role in a 1976 Cuban airliner bombing that killed 73 people . Some 20 years ago , a Venezuelan court acquitted him of a role in the bombing . He later escaped from prison while awaiting a new trial . In May , U.S. officials rejected a Venezuelan request for his arrest , citing a lack of evidence against the Cuban exile who holds Venezuelan citizenship . Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has sought the support of Pakistanis in the fight against religious extremism and terrorism . He underlined the need of ridding the society of extremism and terrorism , saying they are hurting Pakistan 's image by their actions . In a broadcast address to the nation Thursday , General Musharraf promised " stern action " against those involved in the printing , publication and distribution of hate material , including newspapers , magazines , pamphlets , and audio and video material . He said no outlawed organization will be allowed to collect donations and action will be taken against those who preach hate in mosques . Some Western leaders have said Pakistan should do more to curb militancy , and that extremists were operating in Islamic schools , or madrassas . General Musharraf said all madrassas in Pakistan must be registered with the government by the end of this year . U.S. health officials have called for updated quarantine procedures , including better access to airline and ship passenger lists , to protect Americans from infectious diseases , including bird flu . The changes , proposed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control , would apply to planes and ships arriving from outside the United States as well as some domestic flights . The CDC also called for giving U.S. health officials more authority to administer medical treatment and vaccinations to quarantined people . Health officials say the need for new regulations became apparent during the 2003 SARS , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak , when authorities found it difficult to get in touch with airline passengers who may have been exposed to the illness . The proposals come amid growing concern about the spread of bird flu , which has killed more than 60 people in Asia since 2003 . Pakistani police have arrested four alleged members of an Islamic militant group in connection with the murder of a prominent Shi'ite Muslim cleric earlier this year . A senior police official , Saud Aziz , says the four wanted in connection with the slaying of Agha Ziauddin in the town of Gilgit in January were picked up in the city of Rawalpindi . The murder sparked sectarian violence that left at least 14 people dead . The official says the suspects belong to the Sunni Muslim Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and that they were plotting to attack Shi'ite events last week but changed their minds because of tight security . The banned group is accused of killing hundreds of Pakistani Shi'ite Muslims in recent years and is believed to have links to the al-Qaida terrorist network . The name " Latvia " originates from the ancient Latgalians , one of four eastern Baltic tribes that formed the ethnic core of the Latvian people ( ca. 8th - 12th centuries A.D. ) . The region subsequently came under the control of Germans , Poles , Swedes , and finally , Russians . A Latvian republic emerged following World War I , but it was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many other countries . Latvia reestablished its independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union . Although the last Russian troops left in 1994 , the status of the Russian minority ( some 30 % of the population ) remains of concern to Moscow . Latvia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 . Bolivia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Latin America . Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early 1980s , reforms spurred private investment , stimulated economic growth , and cut poverty rates in the 1990s . The period 2003 - 5 was characterized by political instability , racial tensions , and violent protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export Bolivia 's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large northern hemisphere markets . In 2005 , the government passed a controversial hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange for a predetermined service fee . After higher prices for mining and hydrocarbons exports produced a fiscal surplus in 2008 , the global recession in 2009 slowed growth . Nevertheless , Bolivia recorded the highest growth rate in South America that year . During 2010 an increase in world commodity prices resulted in the biggest trade surplus in history . However , a lack of foreign investment in the key sectors of mining and hydrocarbons and higher food prices pose challenges for the Bolivian economy . Autonomy for the Swazis of southern Africa was guaranteed by the British in the late 19th century ; independence was granted in 1968 . Student and labor unrest during the 1990s pressured King MSWATI III , the world 's last absolute monarch , to grudgingly allow political reform and greater democracy , although he has backslid on these promises in recent years . A constitution came into effect in 2006 , but the legal status of political parties remains unclear . The African United Democratic Party tried unsuccessfully to register as an official political party in mid 2006 . Talks over the constitution broke down between the government and progressive groups in 2007 . Swaziland recently surpassed Botswana as the country with the world 's highest known HIV / AIDS prevalence rate . First colonized by the Spanish , the islands came under British control in the early 19th century . The islands ' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834 . Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917 , which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry . The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export . Independence was attained in 1962 . The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing . Tourism , mostly in Tobago , is targeted for expansion and is growing . The government is coping with a rise in violent crime . A GOATHERD , driving his flock from their pasture at eventide , found some Wild Goats mingled among them , and shut them up together with his own for the night . The next day it snowed very hard , so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding places , but was obliged to keep them in the fold . He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive , but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them his own . When the thaw set in , he led them all out to feed , and the Wild Goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains . The Goatherd scolded them for their ingratitude in leaving him , when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd . One of them , turning about , said to him : " That is the very reason why we are so cautious ; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long , it is plain also that if others came after us , you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves . " Old friends can not with impunity be sacrificed for new ones . A KIND-HEARTED Physician sitting at the bedside of a patient afflicted with an incurable and painful disease , heard a noise behind him , and turning saw a cat laughing at the feeble efforts of a wounded mouse to drag itself out of the room . " You cruel beast ! " cried he . " Why do n't you kill it at once , like a lady ? " Rising , he kicked the cat out of the door , and picking up the mouse compassionately put it out of its misery by pulling off its head . Recalled to the bedside by the moans of his patient , the Kind-hearted Physician administered a stimulant , a tonic , and a nutrient , and went away . Kids these days , they grow up too quickly and know entirely too much too soon . I mean this one friend of mine was trying to get his boy into Nursery Rhymes . All that happened was that the boy told his shrink that his Father had a lot of problems , including a fixation that a cow could orbit the moon . The fate of seven suspected Somali pirates who were captured by a Spanish warship is uncertain after Spanish prosecutors reversed plans to bring them to Spain to face trial . A Spanish judge , Fernando Andreu , ordered the Somali men released on Friday . However , he refused the prosecution 's request to surrender them to Kenyan authorities , saying it would violate the law , since proceedings were already taking place in Spain . A Spanish ship seized the men off the coast of Somalia Wednesday after their boat capsized during their alleged attempt to hijack a Panamanian-flagged vessel . France is prosecuting 15 piracy suspects in its own courts , though it has transferred others to Kenya , including 11 who were handed over on Friday . China says it punished more than 1200 health workers last year for such corruption as taking commissions from drug companies and accepting bribes from patients . The official Xinhua news agency says investigators from China 's Health Ministry uncovered more than 200 cases of hospital staff members buying and selling medicine for personal profit . The health workers are said to have received $ 1.3 million illegally . Authorities also found that some doctors took bribes for surgeries , even after patients paid their hospital fees . More than 800 health workers were punished for charging illegal fees . China 's Health Minister Gao Qiang said at a nationwide health meeting Saturday that most hospital staff members are doing a good job . But he says those who become corrupt will be punished without mercy . A vault built to safeguard seed samples of the world 's important food crops has opened in the remote Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard . Norway 's Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Nobel-Prize winning environmentalist Wangari Maathai on Tuesday placed the first seeds inside the vault , built in caverns 130 meters inside a frozen mountain . The repository is designed to shield plant seeds and preserve crop diversity in the event of disaster such as climate change , epidemic or nuclear war . The vault has the capacity to store 4.5 million seed samples . The Norwegian government spent $ 9 million to build the vault . Other countries can deposit seeds without charge and reserve the right to withdraw them upon need . More than two dozen Iraqi civilians and policemen have been killed in a wave of bombings Wednesday in Baghdad and parts of central and northern Iraq meant to intimidate voters less than two weeks ahead of national elections . Five bomb attacks were carried out in Baghdad . Wanted terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi 's group ( al-Qaida in Iraq ) claimed responsibility for four of them , including one outside the Australian embassy . The U.S. military reported at least 26 people were killed and many others wounded in those blasts . North of the capital , in Kirkuk , police say a human rights activist and a relative were killed , while in Irbil , a bomb targeted the convoy of the police academy chief , killing a bystander . And in Dohuk , the provincial governor escaped injury when a bomb hit his convoy . A policeman was also killed in a car bombing south of Baghdad , near Hilla . An Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip has killed a top Islamic Jihad commander and at least six other people , a day after an Islamic Jihad suicide bomber killed five people in central Israel . The Israeli military confirmed the Thursday evening helicopter strike near the Jabaliya refugee camp , saying it targeted an Islamic Jihad militant . Palestinians identified him as Shahdi Mohanna , the Islamic Jihad commander for the northern Gaza Strip . They said three other Islamic Jihad activists and three civilians were also among the dead , and at least 15 people were wounded . Earlier Thursday , Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced an offensive he said would not stop until the Palestinian Authority moves decisively to stop militant attacks . He also said he will not hold talks with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas until the attacks stop . A draft peace proposal under consideration by the Afghan government could offer Taliban leaders exile overseas if they agree to stop fighting . The draft plan , seen by reporters for British news organizations Reuters and the Guardian newspaper , also calls for " de-radicalization " classes for insurgents and thousands of new jobs to be created for militants who renounce violence . The proposal comes weeks before a grand council of Afghans , known as a jirga , meets in Kabul on May 29 to discuss how to make peace with the insurgents . Possible peace talks will be a key issue discussed when Afghan President Hamid Karzai meets with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington this week . Russia has ordered its fleet of Su-24 bombers grounded after one of the planes crashed during a training mission . Air force officials said Thursday that a technical problem caused the early morning accident in the Far East Khabarovsk territory . They said preliminary investigation indicates that a technical problem rather than pilot error cause the crash . Russian news media say rescue helicopters found the wreckage more than a 100 kilometers away from the airfield . The two pilots had ejected safely before the crash and were taken to a military hospital for a medical examination . Reports say there was no damage on the ground . The bomber flights are to remain suspended until investigators establish the cause of the crash . Pro-Russian demonstrators in Crimea have protested against the arrival of a U.S. naval frigate in Sevastopol , the Ukrainian port where Russia 's Black Sea fleet is based . News-agency reports from Sevastopol say the demonstrators shouted " NATO out " and " Yankee go home " during their protest Wednesday . Ukraine 's navy says the U.S. naval vessel is on a friendly visit to the Black Sea and is not taking part in any military exercises . Sevastopol 's naval base dates back to Soviet times . Through a lease agreement with Ukraine , Russia will operate the facility until 2017 . Ukraine 's campaign to win NATO membership has been strongly opposed by Moscow , which says it will not accept any further expansion of the western alliance on Russia 's borders . Egypt 's largest opposition group defied authorities and held anti-government protests in Cairo Sunday . Several thousand riot police prevented the Muslim Brotherhood from holding a rally outside the Egyptian parliament as planned . Instead , members of the group gathered in front of a Cairo mosque , shouting demands for political reforms . Authorities say they arrested at least 50 protesters . Estimates of the crowd range from several hundred to 3000 . Smaller protests took place at two other Cairo locations . Egyptian authorities had arrested another 50 Brotherhood members before the protests . The Muslim Brotherhood calls for replacing Egypt 's secular government with an Islamic state . The group was formally banned in 1954 , but its members , running in elections as independents , hold enough seats to make the Brotherhood the largest opposition group in Egypt 's parliament . Russia says it is commissioning its first unit of new mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles . Monday told Russian television the new version of the Topol-M missile is capable of penetrating multi-layered missile defense systems . Ivanov said the missiles will form the core of Russia 's strategic missile forces . He called them a new generation of the stationary Topol system already in service . Western analysts say Topol missiles were first deployed in Russian silos in the late 1990s . The new missiles reportedly can carry a 1200 kilogram payload and have an estimated range of about 10000 kilometers . They are said to maneuver in ways that are difficult to detect . A massive blast at an ammunition shop in Afghanistan 's capital leveled shops and homes , killing at least six people and wounding around nine others . Bystanders joined rescuers Wednesday to dig through the rubble of collapsed buildings in an attempt to find survivors . Descriptions of the scope of the damage vary , with reports saying several to 25 buildings in Kabul were destroyed . Police have not said what caused the blast in the ammunition store . Also Wednesday , a suicide bomber in eastern Afghanistan blew himself up near a police convoy . Police officers in Khost said at least four civilians were killed and more than 30 other people were injured , among them Afghan policemen . Members of a violent Central American street gang have been sent to the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona to attack Minuteman Project volunteers , as they begin a month-long campaign to help patrol the southern U.S. border with Mexico . James Gilchrist , a Minuteman organizer frustrated by the U.S. government 's failure to control illegal immigration , tells the Washington Times newspaper that leaders of Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13 have sent gang members to confront his group in Arizona . More than 1000 civilian volunteers are expected to converge on the city of Tombstone Friday to begin a 30-day border patrol . Likewise , Hispanics from the National Alliance for Human Rights are going to Tombstone to protest the Minuteman Project . Last year , 5,00,000 illegal aliens were caught in Arizona . MS-13 runs a major smuggling operation on the U.S.-Mexico border , running drugs , weapons and undocumented aliens from Central and South America into the United States . The World Bank has approved $ 257 million in loans for business development in Colombia and a project designed to improve the country 's environment . In a statement issued Thursday , the bank says its board of directors allocated $ 250 million to fund a business productivity and efficiency project designed to create businesses , improve their access to financing , and increase overall productivity in Colombia . The Bank allocated another $ 7 million to Colombia for a sustainable development project , aimed at reducing air and water pollution , improve hygiene and urban environmental management . The bank is also loaning El Salvador $ 27 million to support a poverty reduction program known as Red Solidaria , designed to help the poorest Salvadorans by improving health , nutrition and education in the country . Italian opposition politicians are demanding Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi apologize for using an obscenity to refer to anyone who would vote against him in Sunday 's election . During a speech to a group of shopkeepers Tuesday , Mr. Berlusconi used a word regarded by many as an obscenity and by others as an insult . He said using such language was rough but effective . The remark came a day after Mr. Berlusconi traded insults in a political debate with his chief political rival , center-left leader Romano Prodi . Both candidates assailed the other 's fiscal policies , with Mr. Berlusconi calling Prodi a " useful idiot " and Prodi saying the prime minister is like a " drunkard clinging to a lamppost . " Voters go to the polls Sunday and Monday to choose a new government . Polls show many of the voters are undecided . Iraqi police say a roadside bombing in Baghdad Saturday killed at least two people who were taking part in a Shi'ite Muslim religious procession . The attack , in the New Baghdad district , also wounded eight others . Iraqi authorities have boosted security measures as hundreds of thousands of Shi'ite pilgrims flock to Iraq 's holy shrine city of Karbala for the solemn Ashura holiday . Worshipers travel to the shrine each year to mourn the seventh-century killing of the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad . Several pilgrims were killed earlier this week in a spate of attacks targeting worshipers . On Friday , a roadside bomb blast killed at least six Shi'ites in the eastern Baghdad district of Sadr City . Other attacks this week in the city of Mosul targeted the Christian minority as they celebrated Christmas . Are the streets in America really paved with gold ? Moses Bittok probably thinks so . Mr. Bittok , who immigrated from Kenya to the United States , learned last week he had a winning ticket worth nearly $ 2 million from an Iowa lottery . And get this - he realized he had won shortly after taking the oath of U.S. citizenship . As he cashed in his ticket , Mr. Bittok said - quote - " It 's almost like you adopted a country and they netted you $ 1.8 million dollars . " He added that something like this can only happen in America . A top Japanese official is calling for U.N. economic sanctions against North Korea if Pyongyang tests a nuclear device . Shinzo Abe , acting secretary general of Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party , said Sunday that it would be " unthinkable " for Tokyo to do nothing should North Korea conduct such a test . U.S. officials have warned that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear test , citing satellite photos they say show suspicious activity near the coastal town of Kilju . Interviewed on the television program Fox News Sunday , U.S. National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said a nuclear test would be an act of defiance , and prompt Washington and its allies to discuss new steps to punish the North Korean government . North Korea has warned that it will consider any sanctions imposed against it a declaration of war . Authorities in Iraq say a car bomb exploded in central Baghdad early Monday , killing at least three people and injuring two others . The blast occurred near one of the gates to the heavily fortified Green Zone , where the headquarters of the Iraqi government , U.S. forces and most foreign missions are located . Separately , the U.S. military says more than 35 insurgents were killed when coalition air strikes hit five targets in a small western town ( Obeidi ) near the Syrian border . Officials say 25 other insurgents were captured . U.S. and Iraqi forces have been operating in the Euphrates River valley to stem the flow of insurgents and supplies from across the border , ahead of next month 's parliamentary elections . On Sunday , Iraq 's Sunni Arab leaders called for an end to large-scale military operations in mostly Sunni areas , saying they may discourage Sunnis from taking part in the vote . European Union Health Commissioner Markos Kypriano says the EU is increasing its pledge for the fight against bird flu to $ 120 million . The EU pledged the assistance in Beijing Tuesday at a donors conference organized by health experts to raise money to help developing countries contain bird flu . The World Bank and World Health Organization are hoping to raise $ 1.5 billion from rich countries to help poorer nations fight bird flu and prevent a global pandemic . The United States is expected to announce its pledge on Wednesday . Swiss drugmaker Roche said it will donate another batch of Tamiflu , an anti-viral medication , to treat an additional two million people in the event of a bird flu pandemic . A World Health Organization official , Margaret Chan , told the meeting there is a great risk of an epidemic , although the timing and severity is uncertain . The Inter-American Development Bank says the world Haitian disapora sent more than $ 1.6 billion back to families on the impoverished island in 2006 . The bank said Tuesday the money sent to Haiti from overseas equals more than one-third of the country 's gross national product . More than $ 1 billion came from the United States and the large Haitian communities in Boston , Miami , and New~York . Other large contributions came from Canada , France , and the Bahamas . The bank says many of the recipients of overseas money have incomes less than $ 500 a year . They use the extra funds for basic expenses , while others invest it in small businesses and education for their children . Ukraine 's Prime Minister Yury Yekhanurov says the signing of a controversial natural gas deal with Russia has been postponed again . The signing had already been delayed from Saturday to Wednesday . But Mr. Yekhanurov says experts continue to work on the documents . The draft agreement calls for Ukraine to pay Russia nearly twice as much for natural gas . The new price would be $ 95 per 1000 cubic meters , up from the previous rate of $ 50 . The two sides reached the deal January 4 , after a three-day suspension of Russian gas deliveries to Ukraine . The agreement triggered a political crisis in Ukraine , and parliament voted to dismiss the government . The Chinese government has called for new measures to prevent the economy from overheating . The official Xinhua news agency reports the State Council moved on Friday to tighten controls on fixed asset investments and money supply after concluding they increased excessively in the first quarter . China 's banks doled out $ 156 billion in new loans in the first quarter , more than half the target for all of 2006 . The Chinese economy is growing at a rapid pace , topping nine percent in the last two years . Leaders are concerned the pace could raise inflation rates or lead to investment in unnecessary projects . The central bank said the growth of the broad money supply rose nearly 19 percent on a year-on-year basis to $ 3.9 trillion by the end of March . A media rights group says Burma 's military-led government has released two Burmese journalists working for a Japanese television station . Reporters Without Borders and the Burma Media Association welcomed the release of the reporters after two days of detention . They say the journalists are in good shape - despite being shaken by the incident . The two journalists were arrested Monday after they went to a port near Rangoon to verify the arrival of a North Korean cargo ship . The reporters , Aung Shwe Oo and his daughter , Daw Sint Sint Aung , both work for Nippon News Network 's Bangkok bureau . Images of the Indian Ocean floor show a giant landslide at the starting point of the earthquake triggered tsunami that devastated regional coastlines on December 26 . The digital map has been produced by a British survey ship HMS Scott that has been collecting data off the coast of Indonesia 's Sumatra Island since early January . The probe of the area where two pieces of ocean floor collided shows a ridge of mud hundreds of meters thick where the seawater was forced up to form the tsunami . Scientists on the ship say that while the data will not help predict when earthquakes will occur , it could help in warning of future tsunamis . A Republican Congressman says he is temporarily stepping down from a House committee-chairman position while he is being investigated for corruption . Ohio Representative Bob Ney is the second lawmaker to relinquish a House leadership post in recent months . He said in a statement Sunday that the allegations against him have become a distraction to lawmakers , including those in the committee he chaired , the House Administration Committee . Ney has been identified as the unnamed lawmaker that lobbyist Jack Abramoff said accepted lavish gifts and financial contributions in exchange for favors and support . Abramoff has pleaded guilty to fraud and tax evasion . Ney denies any wrongdoing . Texas representative Tom DeLay stepped down as House Majority Leader late last year after being indicted for alleged campaign finance violations . DeLay had close ties to Abramoff and some of the congressman 's aides are being investigated in the Abramoff scandal . One of the suspected bombers in the failed July 21 attacks on London 's transport system is being extradited from Italy to Britain . A plane carrying Ethiopian-born Hamdi Issac , also known as Osman Hussain , left Rome 's Ciampino airport around midday Thursday , for London . Italian police arrested the British citizen in Rome a week after the July 21 attacks , which caused no fatalities but brought chaos to London two weeks after suicide bombers killed 52 people in the British capital . Hamdi Issac has admitted to taking part in the second set of attacks but has said the action was meant to scare people , not kill them . Italy 's highest court upheld his extradition order on September 13 . The surging Mississippi River spilled over levees in two towns in the state of Illinois and is threatening to deluge other parts of the central United States . The Army Corps of Engineers says 20 levees in the central U.S. have already overflowed - and up to 30 more are in danger of overflowing . Central U.S. river towns are at risk as floodwaters that submerged parts of two of the state of Iowa 's largest cities are now flowing downstream . Residents have joined members of the National Guard in a desperate effort to strengthen levees with sandbags . Meanwhile , Iowa is cleaning up after widespread flooding inundated homes , destroyed crops and cut off highways and bridges . At the White House Tuesday , U.S. President George Bush expressed concern for the flood victims . He is to visit Iowa Thursday to inspect the damage . A U.S. government audit shows that at least 232 civilians have been killed while working on U.S. reconstruction projects in Iraq . The report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction indicates the death toll of those employees for private contractors increased 93 percent in recent months ( the fourth quarter of 2004 ) . In addition to those killed , 728 claims were filed for employees who missed more than four days of work . The inspector 's report says " Iraq 's unsettled security environment continues to present grave risks for contractors and employees . " The quarterly report sent to U.S. Congress based its information on statistics from the U.S. Labor Department compiled from workers ' compensation claims filed by all U.S. government contractors . Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet has been indicted on human rights charges and placed under house arrest . Judge Victor Montiglio charged General Pinochet in connection with the kidnapping and disappearance of seven people in the early years of his 1973 to 1990 rule . The charges are part of a human rights case known as " Operation Colombo , " in which 119 dissidents disappeared while in custody . Mr. Montiglio 's indictment Thursday comes six days after he questioned the ex-dictator and the former head of the secret police , Manuel Contreras , to determine responsibility for the disappearance of the 119 Pinochet foes . This is the second indictment in two days against the former dictator . General Pinochet , who turns 90 on Friday , had just made bail following his indictment Wednesday on charges of tax evasion , corruption and using FALSE passports in a case involving an estimated $ 27 million hidden in foreign bank accounts . Leaders of the South American trade bloc Mercosur are meeting in Venezuela to formally welcome Venezuela into the group . Presidents of member nations Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay are to sign a document Tuesday extending voting rights and lower tariffs to Venezuela . With the new member , officials say the trade bloc will account for $ 1 trillion in annual economic activity and include 250 million people . Bolivian President Evo Morales also is to attend the summit for talks with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to discuss the price of gas exports to Brazil . Bolivia is an associate member of Mercosur , formed in 1991 . Meanwhile , Paraguay 's President Nicanor Duarte has threatened to abandon the group because of alleged protectionist trade policies by Brazil and Argentina . A strong earthquake shook Indonesia 's Aceh province just before midnight Saturday ( about 1657 UTC ) , causing residents to flee their homes in panic . The magnitude 5.8 quake was centered 33 kilometers under the Indian Ocean and about 33 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital of Banda Aceh . Officials say there have been no reports of damage or casualties , but residents of the city ran out of their homes in panic after the quake jolted them awake . A magnitude 9 quake off the west coast of Aceh triggered the December 26 tsunamis , which the U.S. Geological Survey says killed more than 2,75,000 people around the Indian Ocean . That includes 1,31,000 in Aceh . U.S. Democratic senators have criticized President Bush 's proposal to revamp Social Security , on the eve of the retirement program 's 70th anniversary . Senator John Kerry , the 2004 democratic presidential candidate , said in a radio address delivered in Spanish Saturday that the president 's proposal to add private investments accounts to the program will hurt Hispanics . Democratic Senator Ken Salazar , from Colorado said in a separate English-language radio address Saturday the president is fabricating a crisis in the retirement program so he can push through his proposals to change it . President Bush says his plans will help the program avoid severe funding shortfalls over the next few decades . A key part of his proposal is to allow younger workers to privately invest some of their Social Security funds which are now managed by the government . More than 60 African migrants have drowned while crossing the Gulf of Aden on their way to Yemen . Witnesses say at least 15 others swam to safety after their vessel sank close to the Yemeni coast . The boat originated from Somalia and most of those on board are believed to have been Somalians . It is not clear how the boat capsized . Migrants frequently attempt the crossing to escape violence in Somalia and often rely on smugglers to help them cross . They often face abuse at the hands of smugglers , with many forced to disembark offshore to avoid Yemeni coast guard patrols . Earlier this month , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated 20000 people have made the crossing this year and said at least 439 people have died and another 489 are missing . Police in Afghanistan say attackers have shot and killed an Afghan senator who briefly served as prime minister in the early 1990s . Authorities say Abdul Saboor Farid was killed late Wednesday outside his home in the capital , Kabul . Mr. Farid was Afghanistan 's prime minister for one month in 1992 during the chaos of a civil war that followed the defeat of the Soviet army . The motive for the senator 's killing is not clear . In another development , police say a remote-controlled roadside bomb tore through the side of an Afghan army bus Thursday in Kabul , killing the driver and wounding 29 people . Taleban militants claimed responsibility for the attack . Meanwhile , the British defense ministry says a British soldier serving with the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan was killed during fighting with militants in the south . NATO has launched large-scale military operations in the region recently to pre-empt an expected Taleban offensive . Insurgents in Iraq killed at least nine people in attacks Sunday northeast of Baghdad . Police say a roadside bomb killed four policemen and wounded nine in Baquba . In another town , Balad Ruz , police say a rocket attack on a policeman 's house killed the man 's brother and four children . Military officials say on Saturday U.S. soldiers killed three gunmen who fired on a patrol in the northern town of Baiji . In northern Iraq , police say the bodies of an elderly tribal leader , Ibrahim Ali al-Nuimei , and his son were found near the town of Kirkuk . In a separate development , the trial of ousted leader Saddam Hussein is scheduled to resume Tuesday with a new presiding judge , and a Western diplomat says members of the former Baathist regime may testify . The United States Government , Wednesday [ May 14 ] officially added polar bears to the list of threatened animals under the Endangered Species Act . Bush administration scientists decided the species is at risk of becoming endangered . Officials cited warming trends and loss of sea ice as threatening the bears , opening a debate over whether to regulate greenhouse gases to protect the bear and its habitat . Paul Sisco reports . Iranian media report that inspectors from the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency will travel to Iran early next month . News reports Saturday quote an unnamed Iranian official as saying a delegation will visit on August 6 to discuss technical issues and regulations . Separately , the United Nations ' nuclear agency is set to inspect Iran 's heavy water nuclear reactor in a matter of days . That reactor is under construction in the industrial city of Arak . It will produce plutonium once it is completed . Enriched plutonium and uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons . The U.N. Security Council has imposed two sets of sanctions on Iran because of its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment . The United States and its Western allies accuse Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons , but Iran says its atomic program is for peaceful purposes . Insurgents have launched two deadly attacks against Shi'ites in Iraq , just hours after U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld paid a surprise visit to American troops in the country . In the first attack , gunmen entered a bakery in a mainly Shi'ite neighborhood in Baghdad , killing at least nine people . A short time later , a car bomb exploded outside a Shi'ite mosque in the town of Balad Ruz , northeast of Baghdad . Abu Musab al-Zarqawi 's group claimed responsibility for that blast that killed 13 and injured 23 others . An American soldier was also killed when a bomb exploded in western Baghdad . The violence came as Mr. Rumsfeld visited U.S. troops in Mosul and Baghdad . He also observed Iraqi police and special forces perform training exercises , before he met with Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi . Nigerian authorities say kidnappers have released a Polish oil worker seized last week in the country 's restive Niger Delta region . The officials say the Polish national was released late Sunday . He was seized Thursday by six gunmen near the southern city of Warri . Abduction for ransom or to press political demands is frequent in the oil-rich Niger Delta . In all , more than 100 foreign oil workers have been kidnapped in the region this year . Most have been released unharmed , often after a payment of ransom . Some kidnappings have been carried out by criminal gangs , while others are the work of militants who want impoverished local villages to get more of the region 's oil wealth . The attacks on the oil industry have caused Nigeria to cut oil production by almost 25 percent . U.S. Treasury officials have frozen the assets of an Ohio-based nonprofit group because they say it has ties to the Palestinian militant organization Hamas . Officials said Sunday that the group named KindHearts has coordinated with Hamas leaders and has ties to two other U.S.-based charities accused of links to terrorism . Those groups were shut down by U.S. officials in late 2001 . KindHearts describes itself on its Web site as a nonprofit charitable organization administering humanitarian aid to the world 's poor . KindHearts officials have not commented on the alleged links to terrorism . Hamas dominated recent Palestinian elections , but U.S. officials regard it as a terrorist organization . The group refuses to recognize Israel 's right to exist and has organized suicide attacks against Israeli targets in the past . China says it has designated three parks in outlying parts of Beijing to be used for public protests during the Olympic Games next month . China 's head of Olympic security , Liu Shaowu , made the announcement Wednesday at a news conference . He said protesters may stage demonstrations if they apply to the government for a permit and are approved . He did not answer questions about whether foreigners could protest in the parks , or whether there would be restrictions on what people could protest about . The city of Athens , Greece , designated such protest areas when it hosted the Olympic Games in 2004 . The International Olympic Committee bars demonstrations at Olympic venues . The international portion of the Olympic torch relay was marred in some cities earlier this year by protests against China 's rule in Tibet . Childhood obesity affects children in most countries in the world according to the International Obesity Task Force . Now , a new study shows that one of the most effective ways of preventing obesity -- exercise -- is something children are not getting enough of . VOA 's Carol Pearson reports . The last Australian aid agency operating in Iraq says it is pulling out . World Vision Australia chief Tim Costello says the situation in Iraq is too dangerous for its staff to remain . He says the work the organization has been doing in Iraq will be handed over to local officials and any unspent funds will be returned to donors . Mr. Costello says the agency made the decision to leave Iraq before the apparent murder of international aid worker Margaret Hassan . World Vision Australia 's Iraqi head of operations , Mohammed Hushiar , was killed in late September in the northern city of Mosul . A published report says the Bush administration is pressing Iraqi leaders to end their political stalemate and form a new government . The New York Times newspaper says Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice telephoned Iraq 's President Jalal Talabani on Friday to urge that the government be formed as soon as possible . It says Ms. Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney conveyed the same message in a White House meeting with Adil Abdul Mahdi , a leading Shi'ite politician named as one of the new Iraqi vice presidents . U.S. officials have said repeatedly that Iraqis must form their own government without American intervention . But efforts to name a new cabinet in Baghdad have failed , although nearly three months have passed since the Iraqi elections . Many Iraqis blame the political turmoil for a recent upsurge in violence . Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is scheduled to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Wednesday in Jerusalem . Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the talks will focus on permanent-status issues , Israeli checkpoints and the fate of Palestinian prisoners . The meeting , at Mr. Olmert 's official residence , will be the first between the two since Mr. Olmert announced that he will step down after his Kadima Party chooses a new leader in September . The two leaders re-started peace talks in November with the goal of reaching a deal by this year 's end . Authorities in Afghanistan say nine Afghan soldiers and 10 Taleban rebels have been killed in two separate ambushes in the country 's restive south . A provincial government official says suspected Taleban rebels attacked the soldiers late Thursday when they were on patrol in the remote Chakul area of southern Helmand province . Later , a person claiming to be a Taleban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack . The U.S. military said 10 Taleban rebels also were killed Thursday during a U.S. helicopter raid in southeastern Khost province after five Afghan soldiers were wounded in an ambush . Taleban activity has eased during the harshest Afghan winter in decades , but officials believe upcoming warmer weather will result in a renewed surge of violence . Britain 's defense ministry has defended its decision to allow the sailors and marines freed by Iran last week to sell their stories - a reversal of usual policy . On Sunday , the ministry said that huge public interest made the circumstances exceptional . Members of the opposition Conservative Party immediately challenged the decision . Many families of British troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan have also said they find the decision distasteful . The two officers among the 15 service members detained in Iran for 13 days have said they have chosen not to profit from stories of their captivity , but others in the group have reportedly made lucrative deals with British media . Several of the the former captives have said they were mistreated during their detention . However , a video released Monday , by Iran shows the sailors and marines relaxing and socializing during their captivity . The weather in the western U.S. state of California has helped firefighters gain greater control of a massive wildfire that is burning near the populous city of Santa Barbara . Fire officials said the winds were calmer overnight and a dense fog rolled in Saturday morning helping firefighters gain control of 30 percent of the blaze , compared to 10 percent on Friday . Authorities said the fire has burned 35 square kilometers and has damaged 80 homes in the area known for its large mansions and scenic ocean views . Before now , strong overnight winds and dry conditions had been making it difficult to keep the blaze from spreading . The fire , which began on May 5 , has forced the evacuation of more than 30000 . More than 4200 personnel are battling the wildfire . A top aide to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki says the government has launched an inquiry into the conduct of the execution of Saddam Hussein and how it was secretly filmed and distributed . The official execution tape , which had no sound , showed the former dictator being led to the gallows but not his actual hanging . However , video captured on a mobile phone camera showed footage and sound of Saddam being taunted and then dropping to his death . In the mobile phone footage , one person can be heard shouting " Moqtada , " the name of a radical Shi'ite cleric and opponent of Saddam . The unauthorized video has caused anger among many Saddam supporters , who say it shows that the execution was a sectarian act against the deposed Sunni Arab leader . Tuesday , Sunni Arab mourners in Saddam 's hometown Tikrit and other cities marched to pay their respects to the former dictator . Local officials in Afghanistan 's northeastern Nuristan Province say three Afghans who had been kidnapped earlier in the week have been found unharmed . The three had been reported abducted from a house in the Kamdesh district of Nuristan Province . At least two of the three Afghans were election workers . No further details were immediately available . More than three years after a U.S.-led coalition ousted the Taleban regime , loyalists are waging an escalating guerrilla campaign ahead of Afghanistan 's September parliamentary vote . In recent days in Kandahar Province , a judge and a district administrator were killed in attacks believed to have been carried out by insurgents . More than 700 people have been killed in the violence this year . World famous Russian cellist and conductor , Mstislav Rostropovich , who appeared frail at his 80th birthday celebration last month , has been hospitalized in Moscow for the second time this year . A spokesman for the cellist said Thursday he is undergoing routine treatment . Following his earlier hospitalization in February , Russian news media reported that he was being treated for cancer . At the time , Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the hospital to confer a medal honoring Rostropovich for his extraordinary achievements in music . Rostropovich and his wife , soprano Galina Vishnevskaya , left the Soviet Union in 1974 in response to political persecution . They returned to Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union and are running a charitable organization aiding orphaned children . The U.S. Internet giant Google is planning to install solar panels at its headquarters in the western state of California to run some of its operations with energy from the sun . The leading Internet search engine says it will install enough solar grids at its complex in Mountain View , California to generate 1.6 megawatts of electricity . That 's enough energy to light up about 1000 California homes . The company hopes the sun will produce 30 percent of the power needed to run its 93000 square meter complex . Google says it wants to set an example that renewable energy can be profitable . The Israeli parliament has rejected a bill calling for a national referendum on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 's plan to evacuate settlers and troops from the Gaza Strip and four small West Bank enclaves later this year . Monday 's vote of 72-39 all

four of 120 settlements in the occupied West Bank . A referendum would have delayed the withdrawal for months from its July starting date . Meanwhile , Israeli troops raided the West Bank Palestinian town of Jenin today , arresting eight accused members of Islamic Jihad . The Israeli army alleges the suspects were making crude rockets

assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri . Diplomatic sources say five Syrian officials are being questioned at U.N. offices in Vienna . The interviews are expected to continue until Wednesday . The sources say the suspects arrived in the Austrian capital late Sunday . Damascus recently agreed to allow its officials to be questioned outside Syria . Syria denies any involvement in the February 14 bombing in Beirut that killed Mr. Hariri and 20 other people . However , a report by a U.N. commission in October implicated top Syrian and Lebanese officials . The U.N. Security Council has warned Syria to cooperate fully with the probe or face consequences . Earlier this year , Syria was forced to withdraw its troops from Lebanon under intense domestic and international pressure . Aides to U.S. Senator - and former first lady - Hillary Rodham Clinton have confirmed that the New~York senator has invited supporters from the state of Iowa to her Washington , D.C. home for a private political fundraising event . Senator Clinton is facing re-election in New York in 2006 , but the invitation of Iowa supporters raises speculation that a 2008 bid for the U.S. presidency is likely . Iowa is traditionally the first state to hold political caucuses in which candidates from the same party compete against each other for their party 's presidential nomination . Mrs. Clinton 's former national finance director from her 2000 Senate campaign is currently on trial in Los Angeles federal court on charges he lied to regulators about the cost of a lavish Hollywood fundraiser . Neither Mrs. Clinton nor her husband , the former president , are accused of any wrongdoing . Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi met Saturday with a top United Nations official . Aung San Suu Kyi spoke to reporters Saturday at her lakeside home in Rangoon , and praised the talks with Vijay Nambiar , chief of staff for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . The 65-year-old Nobel peace prize laureate has been vocal about pursuing democratic reforms since her release November 13 from more than seven years of house arrest . But she has also been careful not to verbally challenge Burma 's ruling generals . Nambiar also met Saturday with Burma 's foreign minister . He also planned to meet with diplomats and recently-elected lawmakers . Pakistani officials say security forces have arrested at least three al-Qaida suspects after a gunfight near the Afghan border . They say police opened fire Monday on a car carrying the suspects outside the northwestern city of Peshawar and forced it to stop . Reports say one of the suspects escaped while the others were arrested . This comes less than a week after Pakistani officials said a senior al-Qaida explosives expert was killed in a raid on a suspected insurgent hideout in the tribal region of North Waziristan bordering Afghanistan . Egyptian-born Muhsin Musa Matwali Atwah was wanted in connection with the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania . The United States offered a $ 5 million reward for his capture . Six other Islamic militants were killed in the raid . Rebels in eastern Sudan say government war planes have been bombing a rebel area near the border with Eritrea , wounding several people . A spokesman with rebels known as the Eastern Front said Friday , the bombing began Thursday in the Barka Valley region near the town of Tokar , 120 kilometers south Port Sudan on the Red Sea . The French news agency quotes a rebel spokesman as saying many civilians have been injured by the bombs , and much livestock has been killed . He says the bombings continue Friday . There has been no independent verification of the air strikes . Fighting broke out between the rebels and government troops near Tokar early this week . Two Sudanese rebel factions joined forces in February to form the Eastern Front . Pope Benedict XVI has visited the Italian city of L'Aquilla and other central Italian locales devastated earlier this month by a deadly earthquake . The pontiff Tuesday visited several sites in L'Aquilla , a medieval walled city of 70000 residents . His stops included the site of a partially-collapsed college dormitory , and the ruins of the 13th century Santa Maria di Collemaggio basilica . Speaking to survivors , he called for " an examination of conscience " by builders and inspectors accused of shoddy construction practices linked to the collapse of numerous buildings . Benedict earlier visited the village of Onna , where 40 of 300 residents perished . The 6.4 magnitude quake on April 6 reduced large sections of the Abruzzo region to rubble . The Italian government has earmarked more than $ 10 billion for reconstruction in the region . Experts say it will take about $ 16 billion to rebuild the area . The top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan says Taleban insurgents could stage a high-profile attack over the next six to nine months , despite what he called their more limited " terrorist capabilities . " Lieutenant General David Barno told reporters Saturday the Taleban fighters are becoming more desperate to " change the course of events in Afghanistan . " General Barno said he expects a small hard-core remnant of the Taleban to continue fighting even as the group 's military strength fades away . Afghanistan is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on September 18 , a little less than one year after the country 's first direct and democratic presidential elections . Three world leaders who had key roles in the reunification of Germany gathered Saturday to share their memories of the collapse of the Berlin Wall . Germany 's ex-chancellor Helmut Kohl , former U.S. president George Herbert Walker Bush , and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev were honored at a gathering in Berlin for their efforts in reunifying Germany . Former Chancellor Kohl now speaks with difficulty after a stroke and is confined to a wheelchair . He said that although Germany 's history was not always proud , Germans should be proud of their country 's reunification . At the close of World War II , Germany was divided into two separate countries governed under separate ideologies of democracy and communism . The wall was built starting in 1961 and came to symbolize the divide between the so-called Iron Curtain and the democratic West . The wall was breached on November 9 , 1989 as a worldwide audience watched on live television . Thousands of Icelanders marked the 90th anniversary of sovereignty from Denmark Monday by demanding the government resign over the country 's economic crisis . Hundreds of marchers tried to storm central bank headquarters in Reykjavik . They left after a tense hour-long standoff with riot police . The global financial crisis has left Iceland 's economy in shambles . Three major banks have collapsed , unemployment has soared , and the value of the krona has plunged . Prime Minister Geir Haarde has refused to resign or call for early elections . He blames Iceland 's economic calamity on commercial bankers . The government was forced to ask the International Monetary Fund and several countries for a multi-billion-dollar loan . Global health experts said cancer will become the leading cause of death in the world by 2010 , overtaking heart disease . A World Health Organization report issued Tuesday said one factor behind cancer 's growing deadliness is rising cigarette smoking in developing countries . 40 percent of the world 's smokers are thought to live in China and India alone . The WHO report said an estimated 12 million people will be diagnosed with some form of cancer this year . It predicts that 7.6 million of them will die . Health experts predicted the number of people who die from cancer will soon be greater than deaths from AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria combined . The WHO said the number of new cancer patients may rise to 27 million a year by 2030 , with 17 million people dying from the disease . A civil liberties group says it has obtained documents that allegedly show U.S. military forces tried to suppress reports about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners . The documents - released by the American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday - say staff members of the Pentagon 's Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) witnessed several incidents of abuse , including prisoners being assaulted , deprived of sleep and humiliated . The documents also included complaints that DIA personnel had their e-mails monitored by special forces , and were ordered " not to talk to anyone in the U.S. " about what they witnessed . The ACLU obtained the documents after a federal court ordered the Pentagon to comply with a year-old request under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act . Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania says he supports democracy in Ukraine and hopes the upcoming Ukrainian presidential election will be free and fair . Mr. Zhvania , who is currently visiting the United States , made the comment Wednesday in an interview with the Voice of America . He also expressed satisfaction with his U.S. visit , which began Sunday , and says the United States has a great deal of interest in Georgia . Mr. Zhvania has met with a number of high-level U.S. officials , including National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice . He quoted Ms. Rice as saying that Washington recognizes Georgia 's territorial integrity in regards to Abkhazia , a pro-Russian enclave in Georgia that has run its own affairs since the early 1990s . Mr. Zhvania concludes his visit Thursday . South Korean police detained a group of anti-Japanese protesters in Seoul Friday after stopping their attempt to hold a mock funeral for Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi . Hundreds of riot police surrounded about 30 demonstrators who carried an empty coffin and Mr. Koizumi 's picture to a park near the Japanese embassy for the funeral . Earlier , the same group burned a coffin and an effigy of Japanese Ambassador Toshiyuki Takano in front of his residence . They also fired flaming arrows , which failed to reach the house . Anti-Japanese sentiment runs high in South Korea over territorial claims both countries make to a group of small islands controlled by South Korea , and over Tokyo 's approval of history books that critics say downplay Japan 's wartime atrocities . Venezuela 's defense minister says his country is considering building unmanned planes and may look to allied countries - such as Iran - for help . Defense Minister General Raul Baduel said Monday in Caracas that Venezuela has made progress in the development of pilotless planes . He also said that Venezuela will look to other countries for help in maintaining its aging U.S.-made F-5 fighter jets . Venezuela has had trouble maintaining the planes since the United States began blocking arms sales to the South American country . Iran 's foreign minister says nuclear talks remain stalled between his government and European negotiators . Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Tehran , Kamal Kharrazi said Iran has always sought a short-term suspension of its uranium enrichment activities , but Britain , France and Germany are pressing for a permanent one . Iran has suspended its enrichment activities as a good faith gesture during negotiations , but said it will decide in three months whether to continue the suspension . Highly enriched uranium can be used to make fuel for nuclear weapons . The head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization , Gholamreza Aghazadeh , called on the Europeans to speed up the talks . In remarks today , he expressed hope the negotiations would protect Iran 's scientific achievements , which he says the Islamic Republic will never give up . President Bush has declared a state of emergency for the Gulf Coast state of Louisiana , as it braces for the expected onslaught of Hurricane Katrina , set to make landfall on Monday . Saturday 's emergency declaration authorizes federal officials to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance in several Louisiana parishes . Hours earlier , Louisiana and neighboring Mississippi declared their own states of emergency in preparation for the storm , and evacuations of low-lying areas began . Oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated as well , as the 11th named storm of this year 's Atlantic hurricane season churned over the Gulf 's warm waters . At last report , Katrina had 185 kilometer-per-hour winds as it moved slowly toward the west-northwest . Hurricane Katrina slammed into southeast Florida Thursday , leaving at least seven people dead . Israel 's security cabinet has approved a plan to release 900 Palestinian prisoners and withdraw troops from the Palestinian town of Jericho . The plan calls for Israel to free 500 Palestinians after next week 's Israeli-Palestinian summit , and 400 others over the next three months . About 8000 Palestinians are in Israeli custody . Both sides say they hope to reach agreement at the Cairo summit on a formal truce ending more than four years of violence . Meanwhile , Palestinian gunmen interrupted a two-week old de~facto truce Thursday with an attack on an Israeli military vehicle that wounded an Israeli soldier in the occupied Gaza Strip . Witnesses said Israeli soldiers returned fire and killed one Palestinian gunman . The attack came despite renewed efforts by the Palestinian Authority to stop militants from attacking Israeli targets . It was not immediately clear what , if any , effect it would have on summit plans . A Russian spacecraft carrying an American space tourist and two cosmonauts has docked with the International Space Station . The Soyuzcapsule reached the space station Monday -- two days after lifting off from Kazakhstan . It carried cosmonauts Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov and American computer software billionaire Charles Simonyi . He paid $ 25 million for the privilege of a spaceflight and visit to the space station . Simonyi brought with him a gourmet dinner to be eaten Thursday , which Russia marks as Cosmonauts Day -- the anniversary of Yuri Gagarin 's first manned space flight in 1961 . The current space station crew -- Russian Mikhail Tyurin and American astronauts Miguel Lopez-Alegria and Sunita Williams -- return to Earth with Simonyi on April 20 . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says he wants a clear position from the United States regarding implementation of the " road map " plan for peace in the Middle East . Mr. Abbas made his comment to reporters as he arrived in Washington late Tuesday for his meeting Thursday with President Bush . A White House spokesman said Wednesday that Mr. Bush believes the road map is the best plan for achieving his vision of two states , Israel and Palestine , living peacefully side by side . The 2003 plan calls for Palestinians to crack down on terror groups and build democratic institutions ahead of final status negotiations aimed at ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Mr. Abbas said he will also ask for economic aid , and the two men are expected to discuss Israel 's plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip . A published report in Spain says the armed Basque separatist group ETA has taken responsibility for five attacks in the northern part of the country in recent months . The Gara newspaper Tuesday published an ETA statement saying it carried out the five attacks in June and July . ETA says one target was La Peineta stadium , which was the centerpiece of Spain 's failed bid to host the 2012 Olympics . Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has offered to hold peace talks with ETA if it renounces violence . ETA has been blamed for more than 800 deaths since the 1960s , when it began its armed campaign for a separate Basque homeland in northern Spain . The Who cancelled a March 13 concert in Tampa , Florida , after lead singer Roger Daltrey fell ill . The 63-year-old Daltrey walked offstage during the first song ; guitarist Pete Townshend later told the crowd he was suffering from bronchitis and could barely speak . The crowd of 9000 then cheered when Townshend said the show had been rescheduled for March 25 . The Who is currently touring in support of Endless Wire , its first album since 1982 . The band next performs March 17 in Mexico City . The U.S. State Department says the already poor human rights situation in Nepal worsened in the past year , with security forces and insurgents alike committing serious human rights abuses . However , the report says the governments of India and Sri Lanka generally respected the rights of citizens , although serious problems remain . The State Department criticizes Sri Lanka 's government and the Tamil Tiger rebel group for violating a ceasefire accord in place since 2002 . It also says Indian officials have used anti-terrorism laws to justify the use of excessive force against insurgents in Jammu and Kashmir . The report describes the human rights situation as poor in Afghanistan , a country recovering from 20 years of war . It notes violence against women and minorities , as well as restrictions on personal freedoms . Similarly , the report says the human rights situations in Bangladesh and Pakistan remain poor , as extrajudicial killings and politically motivated violence continue . Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas says he may resign if a Hamas-led government prevents him from advancing the Mideast peace process . In a British ( ITV ) television interview broadcast Sunday , Mr. Abbas said Hamas must abide by existing Palestinian Authority commitments recognizing Israel and denouncing the use of violence . He said that if he can not continue his policies regarding Israel , he will resign . Mr. Abbas was elected for a four-year term as president of the Palestinian Authority in January , 2005 . Hamas , considered a terrorist organization by the West , wrested control of the legislature from the ruling Fatah party in parliamentary elections last month . Hamas leader and Palestinian Prime Minister-designate Ismail Haniyeh said Sunday his militant group is ready to recognize Israel , if Israel gives the Palestinian people a state on lands occupied since the 1967 war . European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has called on EU governments to release blocked Chinese textile shipments , saying a failure to do so could cause economic hardship in Europe . The announcement followed talks with Beijing aimed at revising a June textile quota agreement limiting shipments to Europe . Those quotas filled so quickly that millions of items of Chinese-made clothing were left stranded at customs checkpoints . Mr. Mandelson Tuesday said the economic consequences of not allowing the goods to enter Europe will be severe for small retailers . He said delaying the shipments could also cause higher prices and shortages in the next few months . EU textile producers say the imports are harming their business , but retailers say they have already paid for the Chinese clothing and want the items released . Iraqi officials say authorities have regained control of the southern city of Diwaniyah , after fierce clashes with Shi'ite militiamen that claimed more than 70 lives . The office of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki says 23 government soldiers and 50 gunmen were killed in the fighting Monday . Several civilians also were reported to have died . The fighting ended after a deal was reached between officials and Shi'ite militiamen loyal to radical Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr . Meanwhile , some 30 Iraqis were killed and a number of others wounded in a fuel pipeline explosion near Diwaniyah . The victims may have been trying to syphon fuel at the time of the blast . In Baghdad , police say they found the bodies of at least 20 people who had been shot and dumped in the capital . The U.S. military has reported the deaths of 10 American soldiers in hostile action in Iraq since Sunday . Sri Lankan military officials say at least 18 Tamil rebels and two government soldiers have died in separate clashes . Officials said Sunday that the navy attacked a rebel camp on Iranativu island off the northern coast Saturday , destroying a rebel boat and killing four Tamil fighters . The military says the other 14 rebels died in fighting across several northern districts Saturday . The military reports rebel casualties almost daily , and both sides are known to exaggerate the number of people killed . The latest fighting raged despite a cease-fire offered by the rebels to take place during a regional summit in the capital , Colombo . The rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic Tamils in Sri Lanka 's north and east since 1983 . They complain of discrimination by the ethnic Sinhalese majority . President Bush has signed legislation reaffirming U.S. support for the continued expansion of NATO . The measure designates Albania , Croatia , Georgia , Macedonia and Ukraine as eligible to receive financial assistance as they pursue NATO membership . It also specifies that funds for military assistance for these countries should be included in next year 's budget . But the White House announcement did not specify a figure . Al-Qaida 's deputy leader , Ayman al-Zawahiri , has warned that the Persian Gulf region and Israel will be the terrorist group 's next targets . The Egyptian-born Zawahiri issued the threat in a videotaped message that was broadcast Monday - the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States . Zawahiri warned of " new events " and suggested that militants should target Western economic interests . The deputy-leader also accused Western powers of stealing " Muslim " oil . Zawahiri stressed that Western leaders should be more concerned about attacks in the Gulf or Israel than violence in Iraq or Afghanistan . He also made the first indirect threat against United Nations peacekeepers bound for Lebanon . Zawahiri said the force is " hostile to Islam . " The message was not dated , but Zawahiri referred to the war between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas . An animal rights group says more than 40 dolphins are being held under what it calls " appalling " conditions in the Solomon Islands . The World Society for the Protection of Animals says the dolphins are being kept in cages in overcrowded , shallow and polluted pens off the island of Gavutu in the Pacific island nation . The group says the dolphins suffer from cuts , scratches and sunburn , and appear to be undernourished and stressed . The group urged the Solomon Islands to rehabilitate and release the dolphins into the wild . Last year , 28 dolphins were transported by plane from the Solomon Islands to Mexico , sparking international criticism . A reporters ' advocacy group has condemned the shutdown of a Somali radio station and the detention of two of its reporters . The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says it is alarmed by the closure of Radio Shabelle in the city of Baidoa on Sunday . Somalia 's transitional government shut down the station after it broadcast a report saying 300 Ethiopian soldiers had crossed into Somalia . Ethiopia has denied the report . The advocacy group quotes Radio Shabelle 's deputy director Mohamed Amiin as saying militiamen entered its premises and detained the two journalists , Mohamed Adawe and Ali Mohamed Saed , for about eight hours . It says the government gave no explanation for its action . The station remained off the air on Monday . Deputy Director Amiin says the station stands by its report that Ethiopian troops took up positions at Baidoa 's airport on Saturday . The U.S. military says the trials of three Army reservists charged with abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison will be moved to the United States . In a statement released late Wednesday , officials say the courts martial of Specialist Charles Graner , Sergeant Javal Davis , and Specialist Sabrina Harman would be held early next year in Fort Hood , Texas instead of Baghdad . No reason for the change of venue was given . Three other U.S. troops have pleaded guilty in connection with prisoner abuse at the Baghdad prison . Most of those charged were part of a military police company based in the U.S. state of Maryland . The prisoner abuse scandal erupted in April when photographs of U.S. soldiers taunting and humiliating naked Iraqi prisoners became public , sparking worldwide condemnation . A Mexican diplomat says he has met with the leader of Colombia 's second largest rebel group in an effort to broker a peace deal between the group and the Colombian government . Mexico 's Andres Valencia told reporters late Tuesday his talks with National Liberation Army ( ELN ) leader Francisco Galan focused on ways to reduce differences between the rebels and the government in order to set up a possible meeting between the two sides in Mexico . The Colombian government is demanding the group disarm and cease its practice of kidnapping citizens . While other paramilitary groups in the nation have grown rich from the drug trade , the ELN funds itself through kidnapping . A top U.S. official says the importance of opium cultivation to Afghanistan 's economy is declining . Richard Boucher , the U.S. assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs , says about one third of the Afghan economy was based on opium last year . But he added that its production was diminishing due to the growth of the regular economy , including the cultivation of other crops . He said more needed to be done to develop economic alternatives to opium production in Afghanistan . The country is the world 's number one producer of opium , a key ingredient in heroin . Boucher is attending an international conference in Berlin on the reconstruction of Afghanistan . Last week , the Bush administration announced it would spend more than $ 10 billion in Afghanistan for security and reconstruction . A U.S.-based human rights group says recently gathered information could lead to new charges against a notorious former Iraqi general who is accused of ordering the 1988 massacre of Kurds in northern Iraq . In a report issued Thursday , Human Rights Watch says the new information implicates Ali Hassan al-Majid - known as " Chemical Ali " - in the execution of hundreds of Shi'ite Muslims during an uprising in the southern city of Basra in 1999 . Iraqi officials say they expect Chemical Ali to be among the first of several top lieutenants of Saddam Hussein 's regime to go on trial for a range of crimes , including crimes against humanity and genocide . In December , Iraq 's interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said the trials of top officials of the ousted regime would begin within weeks . But so far , no trial dates have been set . A fugitive leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas has appeared in a videotape calling Israel 's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip a victory for Palestinian militants . Mohammed Deif , who has eluded Israeli authorities for more than a decade , said Israel 's pullout is a humiliation suffered at the hands of the armed resistance . The alleged bombmaker , who Israel accuses of being behind a string of suicide bombings , appeared in the video in profile with a dark shadow over his face . He warned the Palestinian Authority not to try to disarm the militant groups . But he did call for dialogue " to protect our Palestinian blood . " Western news agencies in Gaza received copies of the tape overnight Saturday . They say they believe the tape is authentic . Pope John Paul II has urged believers to proudly display the signs of their faith , saying the practice does not encourage intolerance or infringe on the separation of church and state . In an apostolic letter to Roman Catholics launching the Year of the Eucharist , the pope made no mention of specific problems . But the message follows sharp controversy in France over a government ban on conspicuous religious symbols such as Muslim headscarves , Jewish skullcaps or large crucifixes in the country 's schools . The pontiff also repeated his concern that too few Catholics are giving due reverence to the Eucharist or properly marking Sunday as the Lord 's Day . He also described faith as a means of counteracting violence and a way of bringing attention to such problems as poverty and hunger in the world . Former U.S. President Bill Clinton says that publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad was a mistake , but that violent protests by Muslims have wasted a chance to build bridges with the West . Clinton was speaking in Pakistan , the scene of some of the worst rallies against the drawings , where he was visiting survivors of last year 's South Asian earthquake and launching an HIV / AIDS project . He said he strongly disagrees with the publication of the cartoons , considered blasphemous by Muslims , and has no objection to the Muslim protests if they are peaceful . But he said by holding violent demonstrations that have killed 18 people , Muslims have missed an opportunity to build better ties with the West . Clinton arrived in Islamabad early Friday for a day-long trip and held talks with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz . Iran says it will allow United Nations nuclear experts to take environmental samples from a military site to disprove allegations Tehran is secretly developing nuclear weapons . A foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters Sunday in Tehran that International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors would only take samples from so-called " green areas " at the military site , and not from inside the installation . The head of the IAEA , Mohamed ElBaradei , said last week Iran had agreed to allow access to the site at Parchin , near the capital , and that inspectors would arrive there soon . The IAEA has been seeking access to Parchin , which has long been used by Iran to research , develop and produce missiles and other high explosives . The United States accuses Iran of secretly developing nuclear weapons . Iran asserts its nuclear program is only for producing electricity . Turkish police have detained at least 50 suspected al-Qaida-linked militants in raids across nine provinces . Local media say the militants , thought to be members of a group ( the Islamic Jihad League ) tied to al-Qaida , were planning attacks against U.S. , Israeli and NATO targets in Turkey . They say the suspects may have had contact with al-Qaida 's second-in-command , Ayman al-Zawahri , and may have been trained in Afghanistan . Turkey 's Hurriyet daily says police Thursday seized an unlicensed gun , documents , CDs and laptops during a search of homes and offices of suspected al-Qaida members in the eastern province of Van . A Moscow court has rejected the appeal of former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky against his conviction on fraud and tax evasion charges , but the court reduced his prison sentence from nine to eight years . Khodorkovsky , once Russia 's richest man , was convicted in May in what his supporters call a political trial in retaliation for the tycoon 's backing of opposition politicians . Thursday 's proceedings got underway after the court repeatedly rejected defense motions for a delay to allow them more preparation time . In a statement to the court , Khodorkovsky proclaimed his innocence and accused bureaucrats opposed to his funding of the political opposition of responsibility for his conviction . Supporters of the former chief of the giant Russian oil firm Yukos say authorities had rushed through the appeal to prevent Khodorkovsky from running in a December parliamentary by-election . The African Union says it is temporarily suspending the deployment of troops to Sudan 's troubled Darfur region because of a fuel shortage . AU officials say the suspension will last several weeks . The Associated Press reports the fuel shortage was caused by the closure of a refinery in Sudan 's capital , Khartoum , for repairs . AU officials say heavy rains in Darfur are also hindering the deployment of troops as some roads have become impassable . Several thousand AU troops and police officers are already in Darfur . The force is expected to number more than 7000 when the deployment is completed . The force is monitoring a cease-fire between Darfur rebels and pro-government Arab militia . The conflict has left 1,80,000 people dead and two million others displaced . China says at least 37 miners died early Sunday in a coal mine accident in the central province of Henan . The official Xinhua news agency says seven other miners are being treated in the hospital for their injuries after what was called a gas " outburst " in the private mine near the city of Dengfeng . The report said 108 people were underground when the accident occurred , and 64 of them escaped . The accident happened one day after a fire at a coal mine in northeastern China killed at least five miners and trapped 30 . Xinhua said the fire broke out Saturday at a mine in Hegang City , Heilongjiang province , while 44 miners were working underground . China 's coal mines are the world 's deadliest , with thousands of people dying every year in explosions , cave-ins and floods . Iraq says it will close its borders and extend curfew hours as part of an extensive security plan to foil insurgent attacks during Thursday 's parliamentary elections . The Interior Ministry says the curfews will begin Tuesday and last until Saturday . During that time , road travel will be restricted to vehicles with special permits . All airports will be closed from Wednesday to Friday . A coalition of Shi'ite religious parties is expected to win the biggest bloc of seats in the new legislature . But analysts predict that no party will win an outright majority , and that a coalition of Shi'ites and Kurds will likely govern . The polls will be the first under the constitution ratified in October in a national referendum . Meanwhile , the U.S. military says an American soldier was killed Sunday when a roadside bomb exploded near his patrol in western Baghdad . A former White House aide to former U.S. President George Bush has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for stealing nearly $ 6,00,000 from a government-funded program that promotes democracy in Cuba . A federal judge sentenced Felipe Sixto on Wednesday for the theft of funds from the Center for a Free Cuba . Sixto resigned as a special assistant to President Bush for intergovernmental affairs last year , after learning the center was taking legal action against him . He pleaded guilty to theft in December and apologized for the crime . Sixto has admitted he bought bulk shipments of radios through two companies he created , then resold the equipment to the center at a higher price . He was the center 's chief of staff before moving to the White House . The Center for a Free Cuba is a non-profit institution dedicated to promoting human rights and democracy in Cuba . A moderate earthquake struck northwest Pakistan Sunday , but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries . The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at a magnitude of 4.9 . Officials say the earthquake was centered in the Hindu Kush mountains of neighboring Afghanistan . Pakistani officials say the earthquake was felt in the capital , Islamabad , as well as Peshawar and Chitral . Police officials say there were no reports of deaths , injuries or damages . Iraqi Sunni leaders say they want more seats on the parliamentary committee charged with drafting the country 's constitution or they will boycott the process . A coalition of Sunni organizations said Wednesday they want to increase their current special allotment of 13 seats to 25 , strengthening their voice on a key committee that could have a total of some 75 seats . The Sunnis have already been granted 11 extra seats on the committee to make up for their small number of legislators - a result of the parliament election boycott by Sunni voters . Shi'ite leaders have not responded to the demands . Meanwhile , insurgent attacks across Iraq Tuesday killed at least 25 people , including three U.S. soldiers . Several hundred anti-war protesters have begun their second week of demonstrations outside President Bush 's Crawford , Texas ranch . At the center of the protests is a California woman whose son was killed in Iraq last year . Cindy Sheehan came to Crawford a week ago demanding to talk to Mr. Bush about the death of her son and the rationale behind the Iraq conflict . On Saturday , dozens of anti-war demonstrators squared off with counter-protesters outside Mr. Bush 's ranch . Authorities turned out in force to keep the two groups separated . Mr. Bush has said he understands the sentiments of anti-war protesters , but he repeated his position that U.S. troops will not be immediately withdrawn from Iraq . A presidential panel says U.S. intelligence about Iran 's arms capabilities is " inadequate . " The New York Times says the panel investigating U.S. intelligence on global weapons proliferation will submit the classified report to President Bush later this month . The commission is expected to also be critical of American intelligence on North Korea , but the newspaper says officials describe the lack of information about Tehran 's capabilities as particularly worrisome . The report says America lacks the intelligence on Tehran 's arms to allow firm judgments about its weapons programs . The United States says Iran is trying to covertly develop nuclear weapons . Tehran insists its nuclear program is for civilian purposes . The International Atomic Energy Agency has been skeptical of Tehran 's claims , but says it has seen no evidence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program . Police in Pakistan say at least five soldiers were killed in a suicide attack in the country 's northwestern Swat Valley . Security officials say a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden vehicle into a security checkpoint in the town of Khawaza Kehla Saturday . At least four soldiers were wounded . Pakistan 's military launched an offensive in Swat and surrounding areas in late April after militants violated a peace deal and began advancing toward the capital , Islamabad . Officials call the operation a success and say most of the Taliban insurgents have been driven from the region . However , Pakistani forces have encountered some lingering resistance . The military says eight militants were killed Saturday in a clash that erupted as soldiers searched another area of Swat Valley . Two others were detained . Elsewhere in northwestern Pakistan , security officials say fighter jets targeted a suspected militant hideout in the South Waziristan tribal region Saturday . Iran 's top nuclear negotiator says Tehran will soon resume large-scale enrichment of uranium if Iran is referred to the United Nations Security Council . Ali Larijani also told a news conference Wednesday that Iran 's main enrichment plant is ready for use . He said all Iran has to do is inform the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would be resuming operations . His comments come one day before the IAEA board meets in Vienna . A draft resolution obtained by news agencies formally calls on the IAEA to report Iran to the U.N. Security Council over its nuclear activities . British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw met his Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki in London today to tell him that Tehran has one last chance to convince the world that its nuclear program is peaceful . European and U.S. leaders accuse Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . Iran denies the charge . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the Bush administration has a strategy to " assure victory " in Iraq . In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Ms. Rice said the plan is to clear out areas under insurgent control , hold those areas securely , and build durable , national Iraqi institutions . She said the United States will send in teams of diplomatic and military personnel working together to help Iraqis train police , and set up essential services . Ms. Rice 's testimony Wednesday comes just days after Iraqis voted in a referendum on a new constitution . Senators pressed the secretary for specifics , including when the 150-thousand U.S. troops in Iraq might start coming home . The secretary refused to offer a timetable , saying any withdrawal depends on Iraqi forces being able to fight the insurgents independently . English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled on Montserrat in 1632 ; the first African slaves arrived three decades later . The British and French fought for possession of the island for most of the 18th century , but it finally was confirmed as a British possession in 1783 . The island 's sugar plantation economy was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid 19th century . Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano that began on 18 July 1995 . Montserrat has endured volcanic activity since , with the last eruption occurring in July 2003 . Georgia 's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10 % in 2006 - 7 , based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government spending . However , GDP growth slowed in 2008 following the August 2008 conflict with Russia , and turned negative in 2009 as foreign direct investment and workers ' remittances declined in the wake of the global financial crisis , but rebounded in 2010 . Georgia 's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes , citrus fruits , and hazelnuts ; mining of manganese and copper ; and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages , metals , machinery , aircraft and chemicals . Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction , banking services , and mining sectors , but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks . The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products . It has sizeable hydropower capacity , a growing component of its energy supplies . Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia . The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline , the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline , and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on Georgia 's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its role as a transit point for gas , oil and other goods . Georgia has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues ; however , the government , since coming to power in 2004 , has simplified the tax code , improved tax administration , increased tax enforcement , and cracked down on petty corruption . However , the economic downturn of 2008 - 9 eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs . The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation , taxes , and corruption in order to attract foreign investment , but the economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically and internationally . After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s , Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of privatization and liberalization that has been undermined since the start of the political crisis . This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level . Agriculture , including fishing and forestry , is a mainstay of the economy , accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing 80 % of the population . Exports of apparel have boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the US . However , Madagascar 's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) led to the termination of the country 's duty-free access in January 2010 . Deforestation and erosion , aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel , are serious concerns . Former President RAVALOMANANA worked aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political crisis , which triggered a 12 % drop in GDP that year . The current political crisis which began in early 2009 has dealt additional blows to the economy . Tourism dropped more than 50 % in 2009 , compared with the previous year , and many investors are wary of entering the uncertain investment environment . Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century , the island was made a French possession in 1853 . It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864 . Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998 Noumea Accord , which over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from France to New Caledonia . The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2019 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence . ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind ; for the Ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth . The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors . They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills , as they had nothing in common and could not live together , but were engaged in unceasing warfare ; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection . Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other , but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men . Hence it arises that Ills abound , for they come not one by one , but in troops , and by no means singly : while the Goods proceed from Jupiter , and are given , not alike to all , but singly , and separately ; and one by one to those who are able to discern them . Turkish security officials say Kurdish rebels have killed 13 Turkish soldiers in a southeastern province near the border with Iraq . Reports from Turkey say the soldiers were killed Sunday in Sirnak province near an area where a Kurdish rebel was killed in earlier fighting . A Turkish army statement said an operation is under way to hunt down the attackers . It also said Turkish troops shelled areas near the Iraqi border to try to prevent rebels from reaching their bases in northern Iraq . Last week , rebels from the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK , ambushed a minibus in Sirnak and killed 12 passengers , including village guards . Ankara signed an agreement with Baghdad last month that commits Iraqi troops to crack down on PKK rebels who Turkey says use northern Iraq to attack Turkey . The deal does not allow Turkey to send its troops into Iraq . Afghanistan 's government says Afghan and U.S.-led troops have killed five Taleban insurgents in the east of the country . The Afghan Defense Ministry says the rebels were killed in a gun fight Saturday in the eastern province of Paktika . Afghan and coalition forces captured one insurgent . In other fighting Saturday , a Canadian soldier was killed in Kandahar province when militants ambushed his patrol with a roadside bomb and gunfire . Separately , Afghan police are searching for the gunmen who killed two German journalists early Saturday in a remote part of northern Afghanistan . The two Deutsche Welle journalists , a man and a woman , were shot dead as they spent the night in a tent in Baghlan province . The area has been relatively calm this year , and the motive for the shooting is unknown . German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier condemned the killings as atrocious and senseless . American Idol narrowed the field of hopefuls to 16 March 1 , bouncing two women and two men . This time , the axe fell on Alaina Alexander , who sang a tepid rendition of the Dixie Chicks ' " Not Ready To Make Nice , " and Nick Pedro , deemed lacking in charisma , according to judge Simon Cowell . Also removed were A.J. Tabaldo and Leslie Hunt , who both sang Nina Simone 's " Feeling Good " . Still in the race , however , is 20-year-old New Jersey native Antonella Barba , whose racy photos have become an Internet sensation . Burma 's detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has appealed to the ruling military against her home confinement . A spokesman for her National League for Democracy says the appeal was sent by the party to the cabinet . Aung San Suu Kyi approved the final draft of her legal appeal during a meeting with her lawyer Kyi Win in September . Last month , the military government released 9000 prisoners , including ten political prisoners in an amnesty ahead of elections planned for 2010 . The NLD won a landslide victory in 1990 elections , but the military refused to acknowledge the win . The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been under house arrest for 13 of the last 19 years . Pope Benedict is calling for swift global action to overcome hunger in the troubled Darfur region of western Sudan . Speaking Sunday , the pontiff said the most basic food needs of hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur are not being met . Earlier this month , the World Food Program said lagging donations had forced it to reduce food rations to 1050 calories per day - about half of an average person 's daily requirement . The Khartoum government and Darfur 's main rebel group signed a peace deal May fifth to end fighting that has killed more than 2,00,000 people and displaced more than 2.5 million others since 2003 . But African Union peacekeepers have been unable to stop militia attacks on civilians since then . Prosecutors in Ukraine say they want to question former President Leonid Kuchma about the death of an investigative reporter five years ago . Officials will pose questions about Georgy Gongadze , an Internet journalist who had been critical of Mr. Kuchma 's government . No date has been set for the interview . The journalist disappeared in September 2000 and his decapitated body was found weeks later . Mr. Kuchma 's former bodyguard says he secretly recorded conversations during which the former leader allegedly implicates himself in the killing . The former president has denied any involvement in Mr. Gongadze 's death . Friday , his former interior minister , Yuri Kravchenko , apparently committed suicide hours before he was to be questioned in the case . U.S. first lady Laura Bush has visited a center for missing children and praised the work of those trying to reunite the families separated by Hurricane Katrina . Mrs. Bush greeted volunteers at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children outside Washington Friday . The center in Alexandria , Virginia says more than 2000 children are still reported missing from the hurricane or are looking for their parents or other caregivers . Photographs and information of the missing , including adults , are posted on the center 's website . Some children are only listed by their first name , as their full identification is still unknown , nearly three weeks after the storm hit . The American Red Cross also has a registry of the missing . Former president Jimmy Carter says the U.S. military should close its detention camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , following allegations of prisoner abuse . Mr. Carter told an audience in Atlanta Tuesday that closing the camp and several other secret detention centers around the globe would show that the United States is committed to defending human rights . Earlier this week , a leading Democrat in the Senate called on President Bush to shut down the Guantanamo camp and launch a massive probe into alleged abuses there . A report by the human rights group Amnesty International criticizes the U.S. military for holding terrorist suspects without charge and for other abuses . Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has rejected the Amnesty report as " absurd , " and he says U.S. officials have no plans to close the camp at Guantanamo . NATO says it is investigating allegations that seven members of a private security company were killed Saturday during an Afghan and coalition force operation . A coalition statement says the deadly shooting happened after its service members had " peacefully detained " a Haqqani facilitator in Paktiya province . NATO says after the joint force used a bullhorn to call for occupants of a vehicle to " exit peacefully , " a man got out of the vehicle with an AK-47 . The alliance says the security force assessed the man " to be hostile " and shot him . NATO says several armed individuals then clashed with the force , resulting in seven deaths . NATO says it is assessing who the individuals were . Brazilian security forces , backed by tanks and helicopters , have carried out an operation to recover stolen weapons from a slum in Rio de Janeiro . More than 1000 soldiers and police officers searched Monday for 10 assault rifles and a nine-millimeter pistol stolen from army barracks by a group of armed men on Friday . A homemade bomb was hurled at soldiers at the entrance of the Providencia slum in the early hours of Monday morning . No injuries were reported . Security officials say police and soldiers exchanged fire with slum residents . Rio is one of the world 's most violent cities . Its slums are often the scene of gang and drug-related violence that kills hundreds of people each year . China has issued a new set of rules that state-media said would better protect religious freedoms in the officially atheist country . The official Xinhua news agency said Sunday that the Religious Affairs Provisions explicitly specify the rights of religious groups , religious sites , and people . They also offer guidance on religious affairs involving state and public interests . Xinhua called the rules a significant step forward in the protection of Chinese citizens ' religious freedom . The U.S. State Department 's Annual Report on Religious Freedom last year rebuked China for poor respect for religious freedom and interference and harassment of people who do not belong to state churches . China requires people to worship in state-sanctioned churches and cracks down on groups outside of the government 's control . A new public opinion poll in the United States says President Bush 's job approval rating has fallen to an all-time low of 45 percent because of the war in Iraq and rising gasoline prices . The ABC News-Washington Post survey published Wednesday found that just over half ( 53 percent ) of the 1600 people surveyed said the war in Iraq is not worth fighting , while 57 percent disapprove of the president 's handling of the conflict . The survey also said 73 percent disapprove of President Bush 's efforts to control the soaring gasoline prices in the United States . The poll said that Mr. Bush 's handing of the war against terrorism received 56 percent approval , the only issue on which he received a majority approval . The poll of randomly selected Americans has a three percent margin of error . Kenyan police say thieves tried to break into the home of Sarah Obama , the grandmother of U.S. presidential hopeful Barack Obama . The 85-year-old Obama told police and Kenyan media that the break-in attempt occurred early Wednesday at her home in the western village of Kogelo . She told a Kenyan newspaper , The Daily Nation , that the thieves tried to get into the house through the kitchen door and then tried to remove a solar panel from the roof . Police say they have arrested four suspects in connection with the incident and are now giving Obama 24-hour protection . Barack Obama was born to a white American mother and a Kenyan father . The Democratic Party candidate is wildly popular among Kenyans , who take pride in his run for the presidency . Sarah Obama is his step-grandmother . Supporters of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe have raised $ 2,50,000 to throw him a lavish birthday party , Saturday . The state-run Herald newspaper says Mr. Mugabe 's 85th birthday will be celebrated in the town of Chinhoyi , north of the capital Harare . Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai , the president 's longtime rival , plans to attend the event . The two men recently entered into a unity government under intense pressure from regional leaders . Mr. Tsvangirai has criticized the president 's birthday parties in the past , saying they waste money in a country crippled by poverty and food shortages . Iraqi Kurdish negotiators say they will resume talks Monday with the country 's dominant Shi'ite alliance to hammer out details of a coalition government . One of the negotiators , Fuad Masoum , says there are further , important issues that need to be resolved before a government is formed . Negotiators have been hoping to agree on a government before Iraq 's National Assembly convenes for the first time on Wednesday . Meanwhile , a roadside bomb south of Baghdad killed two American security contractors Sunday . To the north , in Mosul , witnesses say three Iraqi civilians were killed when a U.S. helicopter fired on insurgents . Also Sunday , a previously-unknown group claimed responsibility for last week 's bomb attack on a Shi'ite funeral that killed 50 people . It says the attack was to demonstrate opposition to Shi'ites who are set to take control of Iraq 's new government . A prominent U.S. newspaper says Washington wants to expand a secret Central Intelligence Agency operation in Pakistan designed to eliminate Islamic militants ' havens near the Afghan border . The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday the U.S. has asked Pakistan in recent weeks to allow more CIA officers and special operations military trainers into the country to participate in Washington 's efforts step up pressure on militants . The report says Islamabad has refused the requests for additional personnel because it remains " extremely wary " of a larger U.S. ground presence in Pakistan . The newspaper reports the number of CIA personnel in Pakistan is " highly classified , " but says it " has grown substantially " in recent years . The Wall Street Journal says Washington wants Islamabad to take " more aggressive action " against groups allied with al-Qaida . The death toll from a passenger train derailment in southern India has risen to at least 77 people , after rescue workers retrieved more bodies from the mangled wreckage . Authorities say the accident occurred Saturday , near the town of Veligonda in southern Andhra Pradesh state . They say heavy rains washed away a portion of the tracks and that the train derailed and fell into a swollen river . Officials say at least 100 injured passengers were rescued from the seven cars that plunged into the flood waters , but that many more remain trapped inside . Indian television images showed corpses lying on the soft marshy ground , many clad in brightly colored , but sodden clothes . Rescuers used ropes to help them wade through the water to reach the train carriages and then drag bodies onto higher land . A laboratory in Hong Kong has confirmed it was the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu that killed two Indonesian children from the same family this month . An Indonesian Health Ministry official said Saturday the deaths in West Java province raise the country 's toll from bird flu to 14 confirmed cases . A three-year-old boy died Tuesday at a provincial hospital . His 13-year-old sister died the previous week , and a third sibling is suffering symptoms of the virus . Elsewhere , Ukraine has confirmed a new outbreak of bird flu among birds in the southern Crimea Peninsula . Ukrainian officials say they do not yet know if the birds had the H5N1 strain . The World Health Organization has confirmed more than 80 deaths from bird flu in East Asia and Turkey since 2003 . An outbreak of cholera in West Africa has killed at least 177 people and sickened more than 9000 in Guinea-Bissau within the past month . In an attempt to control the outbreak , the government has banned the sale of water at markets . Cholera is an intestinal infection usually spread through contaminated water or food . It causes life-threatening dehydration if not treated . Health officials say this year 's rainy season in Guinea-Bissau has created favorable conditions for the spread of the disease . Flooded latrines can contaminate nearby well water . The World Health Organization says Burkina Faso , Guinea , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger and Senegal also have seen a rise in cholera cases . Germany 's highest court has ruled that random data profiling for terror suspects is legal only when the country faces a specific threat to security or lives . Germany 's Constitutional Court ruled Tuesday that the general threat of terror since September 11 , 2001 , does not warrant random profiling . Analysts say the ruling could force many German states to revise laws on random searches . The measure stems from the case of a Moroccan student in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia , who challenged scanned data on five million men who were profiled following the 2001 terror attacks on the United States . No terror suspects were found in the data search . Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein criticized today 's ruling , saying data profiling is an effective way to combat terrorism . Israeli soldiers on stand by in the Gush Katif bloc of Jewish settlements leading to the site were Palestinian militants attacked an army post near Egypt-Gaza border Israeli security officials say three soldiers have been wounded in an attack by Palestinian militants . Israeli officials say two militants fired light arms and rocket-propelled grenades at soldiers and civilians near any army post on the Gaza-Egypt border Sunday . Authorities say the soldiers returned fire , killing one of the attackers . The militant group Islamic Jihad said the attack was a joint operation between its militants and those affiliated with the Fatah movement of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas . Sierra Leone 's U.N.-backed war crimes tribunal has accused former Liberian President Charles Taylor of backing an attempt to kill Guinea 's president . The court 's chief prosecutor David Crane says the exiled former leader ordered the assassination of Guinean President Lansana Conte in January to punish him for allegedly supporting rebels in Liberia . A spokesman for Mr. Taylor has denied the charge . He has lived in exile in Nigeria since 2003 when he stepped down under pressure from advancing rebels and the United States . Before Mr. Taylor left office , the special court indicted him on war crimes charges for backing rebels during Sierra Leone 's 10-year civil war . Meanwhile , the United States House of Representatives is expected to pass a resolution calling on Nigeria to hand Mr. Taylor to the tribunal . Panama says drug-running Colombian rebels have planted landmines in Panama near the two countries ' shared border . Panamanian Security Minister Jose Mulino said Friday that whoever planted the mines is apparently " protecting something " in the area . Mulino did not say how many mines were found in the Darien region where two police officers were wounded last week in a mine blast . The region has been the scene of occasional incursions by rebels into Panamanian territory in the past . Palestinian officials say Israeli soldiers have shot and killed at least two Palestinians in separate incidents in the West Bank . Early Sunday , Israeli troops killed a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in a refugee camp in Nablus . An Israeli army spokesman said soldiers opened fire on two gunmen , killing one and wounding the other . In the other incident , near Hebron , Israeli forces killed a man who was involved in a shootout between two Palestinian families . An Israeli army spokesman says the man was armed . Separately , in the Gaza Strip , Hamas security forces say they found a bomb near the Palestinian parliament building . Hamas blamed members of the rival Fatah movement for planting the device . Hamas seized control of Gaza in June after factional fighting with Fatah that killed more than 100 people . The Turkish Weightlifting Federation has been fined $ 1,00,000 and suspended from all international competitions until May 31 following a series of anti-doping violations . In a statement Tuesday after a meeting in Doha , Qatar , the International Weightlifting Federation 's executive committee sanctioned Turkey 's federation for " bringing the sport of weightlifting into disrepute . " The fine must be paid before Turkey can be readmitted to the sport 's International Federation , with the money to be used for anti-doping activities . The IWF also directed the Turkish Federation to identify and sanction athletes and coaches involved in the violations , and develop an anti-doping education program to be approved and monitored by the world body 's executive board . Brazil 's president is pledging to invest at least $ 1.7 billion to develop Rio de Janeiro 's slums . In a speech on Monday , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said the state should meet its obligations to slum dwellers or else drug traffickers will take over the shantytowns . He added that Brazil can defeat organized crime only if the government improves the country 's poorest areas . Mr. da Silva spoke a few days after a police raid on drug gangs killed at least 13 people in a slum . The announced investment will provide basic services such as water and sewage systems , as well as basic facilities such as schools and hospitals . The money is expected to benefit two million families in the state and city of Rio de Janeiro . Brazil 's federal , state , and municipal governments will all contribute to the fund . Before Hurricane Gustav even made landfall , the American Red Cross had spent $ 12 million organizing 5000 workers and supplies for disaster relief . Now , hundreds of Red Cross chapters nationwide are getting ready for the next group of storms . VOA 's Carolyn Presutti shows how that is accomplished . The United Nations Security Council is expected to discuss a build-up of peacekeeping troops in Ivory Coast later Monday . U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has officially requested the transfer of 200 additional peacekeepers and a police unit from Liberia to protect U.N. personnel and property . On Sunday , Mr. Annan urged the Council for a quick approval . He said in a statement that he is deeply concerned by continued threats against U.N. personnel and by reports that more violent protests and attacks are being planned . The U.N. evacuated hundreds of staffers from Ivory Coast last month after supporters of President Laurent Gbagbo assaulted U.N. compounds . The U.N. currently has 7000 peacekeepers in Ivory Coast , working with 4000 French troops trying to uphold a shaky peace agreement . The West African nation has been divided into a rebel-held north and government-controlled south since a 2002 civil war . U.S. Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has met with a federal grand jury investigating the leak of a covert CIA operative 's identity . Lawyers in the case have said Mr. Fitzgerald may ask the jury to issue charges against President Bush 's chief advisor , Karl Rove , and Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff , Lewis Libby . Mr. Fitzgerald has been conducting a nearly two-year investigation into whether someone in the Bush administration blew the cover of a CIA operative ( Valerie Plame ) in 2003 . It is a federal crime to knowingly reveal a covert agent 's identity . The grand jury is scheduled to expire Friday unless extended by a federal judge . The White House has generally refused to comment on the probe , although media reports indicate Bush administration officials are bracing for at least one indictment . United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan will formally present Monday a report that calls for major reforms of the world body . Among changes Mr. Annan will call for during a speech to the General Assembly is expanding the Security Council from its current 15 members , which includes five permanent seats - the United States , Britain , France , China and Russia . If the Council expands , India , Brazil , Germany and Japan are among nations wanting to be added as permanent members . Another proposal is the creation of a smaller human rights panel to replace the current Commission on Human Rights . The commission has been criticized for allowing some accused human rights abusers to use their membership to protect each other from condemnation . Calls for U.N. reform have increased in recent years , fueled in part by financial scandal in the Iraq oil-for-food program , and the U.S. decision to invade Iraq without Security Council approval . The U.N. nuclear agency says its investigation into an alleged secret nuclear reactor in Syria has made a " good start " after inspectors visited the site . Chief inspector Olli Heinonen said Wednesday that he and two colleagues achieved what they wanted from their first trip to Syria as part of the investigation . The International Atomic Energy Agency official was speaking on his return to Vienna after four days in Syria . Heinonen said his team took samples at the Al Kibar complex in northeastern Syria that Washington says housed a covert nuclear reactor built with North Korean help . Israeli warplanes destroyed the building last September . Heinonen said the agency still has work to do in analyzing samples from the site . He did not say when U.N. inspectors may return to Syria . Damascus denies U.S. intelligence allegations that it built a secret nuclear reactor and accuses Washington of fabricating evidence . Nepal 's new government has released more Maoist rebels detained under a scrapped anti-terror law . At least 182 rebels are now free . The government of interim Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala announced Monday that it was dropping terrorism charges against hundreds of rebels . They were imprisoned by the former royalist government of King Gyanendra . Friends and relatives greeted the former prisoners Tuesday afternoon . The rebels raised their fists in a Maoist salute and chanted Maoist slogans . A Maoist rebel spokesman , Krishna Mahara , says the government has promised to free 350 rebels , although hundreds more will remain in jail . The government decision to release the rebels came following talks on Sunday between Nepal 's home affairs minister , Krishna Prasad Sitaula , and Maoist leader Prachanda in a remote western village . U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama has proposed a clampdown on energy speculation which he believes is responsible for record-high oil prices . Senator Obama Sunday announced the proposal , which would close a legal provision that exempts energy commodies from government oversight . Critics say the deregulation measure , signed in 2000 by then-President Bill Clinton , opened the way to uncontrolled speculation in the oil markets . The price of gasoline has become a campaign issue between Obama and presumptive Republican nominee John McCain . Senator McCain wants Congress to lift a ban on offshore oil drilling , while Obama says such a measure would not help the problem in the short term . Obama 's announcement concides with a major energy summit in Saudi Arabia on ways to rein in the high oil prices . The teenage boy at the center of the latest Michael Jackson scandal says the pop star sexually molested him twice in the singer 's bedroom . The accuser , who testified in a California court Thursday , was a 13-year old cancer patient at the time of the alleged incidents . Mr. Jackson had invited him and his family for a visit in 2003 . The teen also testified that the entertainer urged him to drink wine aboard his private jet and hard liquor at the singer 's ranch . Mr. Jackson has denied all the charges against him . Thursday 's testimony came after the judge threatened to jail Mr. Jackson and revoke his bail when he arrived more than one hour late for court . A Jackson spokesman said the star had been hospitalized for a serious back injury . Pakistan has denied allegations by Moscow that militants have been training on Pakistani territory to carry out terrorist attacks in Russia and the former Soviet central Asian nations . Foreign ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani in Islamabad Saturday said there are no militant training facilities in Pakistan . He said the role and sacrifices made by Islamabad , a key U.S. ally in the war on terror , have been acknowledged by the international community . His comments come one day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had information that people are being trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan with the help of Taleban insurgents to carry out attacks inside Russia . He also alleged that militants have already crossed into the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan . Jordan says it will host a regional conference next week to discuss ways to help hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees who have fled their country 's violence . The state-owned Petra news agency said Thursday Jordan has invited officials from Syria , Egypt , Iraq , the Arab League and the United Nations to attend the meeting in Amman on July 26 . Petra says representatives of Iran , Turkey , Russia and Japan also will take part as observers . It says the delegates will discuss how to ease the burden of countries hosting large numbers of Iraqi refugees . The U.N. refugee agency says Jordan has about 7,50,000 Iraqi refugees , while 1.4 million Iraqis have fled to Syria in recent years . The agency has warned that Iraqi refugees in Syria and Jordan are putting severe strains on healthcare , education systems and housing . Greek journalists and public transportation workers are stopping work in the latest round of strikes protesting Greece 's economic austerity measures . Bus , subway , and tram services ceased in Greece 's capital Athens Thursday , while Greek journalists stopped radio and television broadcasts . Greek newspapers planned not to print Friday . Greece has seen several rounds of labor strikes since the government earlier this year began to raise taxes , freeze civil service pay , and cut pensions in efforts to decrease the country 's massive debt . Greece agreed to take those steps in return for a massive emergency loan from the European Union and International Monetary Fund . South Korea 's ambassador to China is being quoted saying the two countries could open talks on a free trade agreement next year . The report in the state-run China Daily quotes Ambassador Yu Woo-ik as saying the sides " are expected to initiate official FTA talks in 2011 . " China is Asia 's largest economy and South Korea is fourth-largest on the continent . South Korea sends almost one-quarter of its exports to China , but faces growing competition from Taiwan , which just completed a trade agreement with China . South Korea has been pursuing other trade deals to prop up its export-driven economy . An agreement signed last year with the European Union is pending , but a deal with the United States has been stalled in Congress since 2007 because of concerns from the American beef and auto industries . News outlets in the United States are reporting that Christopher Hill , the lead American negotiator on North Korea , is expected to be nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to Iraq . There has been no official confirmation of the reports Monday on CBS , ABC , the Associated Press and Reuters , which quote unnamed officials who say Hill is expected to be the nominee . Hill is currently the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs . Hill has previously served as ambassador to South Korea , Poland and Macedonia . He was also special envoy to Kosovo . Before he started his career in the foreign service , Hill served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Cameroon . If nominated and confirmed by the U.S. Senate , Hill would replace another career diplomat , Ryan Crocker , as Washington 's top diplomat in Iraq . Israeli police say a car bomb in central Tel Aviv has killed the suspected leader of one of the country 's top crime families . Officials say they believe a rival crime family targeted Ya'akov Alperon Monday , in the attack . The blast also slightly wounded two bystanders , including a 13-year-old boy . Media reports say Alperon was returning from a court hearing for his son , Dror , who is facing extortion charges . Witnesses say they heard a huge explosion , and some thought it was a terrorist attack . In June , another car bomb in Tel Aviv killed one of Israel 's top criminal lawyers , in what police said was a criminal , not a terrorist , act . The lawyer , Yoram Haham , had represented several notorious mobsters during his career as a criminal lawyer . U.S. President George Bush has issued a proclamation putting into effect a free trade agreement with Peru . U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said Friday the proclamation marks an important milestone in the relationship between the U.S. and Peru . The agreement gives Peru permanent , duty-free access to the U.S. In return , Peru will eliminate duties on most U.S. industrial and consumer products . The pact was initially approved after discussions between President Bush and Peruvian President Alan Garcia , but Democrats in Congress forced U.S. officials to reopen negotiations and add stronger labor and environmental provisions . Peru 's Congress this week passed modifications to earlier legislation to conform with the trade pact . The agreement will take effect on the first of February . Burma has confirmed additional outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of bird flu virus among poultry in the suburbs of Rangoon . The latest outbreaks were discovered in Hlinethaya , a western suburb of Rangoon . Earlier this week Burmese authorities confirmed a new outbreak of the H5N1 virus on poultry farms , also in Rangoon 's western suburbs . No human cases have been announced in the country . More than 160 people have died from bird flu since late 2003 . Most of the victims came in contact with infected poultry . Experts fear the virus could mutate into a form that is easily transmissible by human-to-human contact . The mayor of Los Angeles , Antonio Villaraigosa , says authorities know of no credible threats to the western U.S. city , following a warning from a suspected al-Qaida member . The warning came in a videotaped statement aired by the U.S. television network ABC on Sunday . A masked man on the tape says " Allah willing , " Los Angeles and the Australian city of Melbourne will be attacked . ABC says the tape was delivered to its office in Pakistan on Saturday . It says the speaker is probably Adam Gadahn , a U.S. citizen wanted for questioning by the FBI for possible terrorist activity . Officials in both Los Angeles and Melbourne say the tape was meant to instill fear , and have advised residents to go about their normal lives . U.S. intelligence officials have refused to comment on whether the taped warning is authentic . The U.S. military says it has uncovered a large stockpile of weapons inside a Fallujah mosque led by a key insurgent leader . The military did not specify the number of weapons found , but called it the " largest weapons cache to date in the city " - a one-time rebel bastion . U.S. and Iraqi government forces are continuing to sweep Fallujah after an assault on the city earlier this month . In southern Iraqi city of Basra , police said they arrested five Arab foreigners suspected of planning attacks . A senior police official said the two Saudi nationals , two Tunisians and one Libyan , who were arrested late Wednesday , had escaped from Fallujah four days ago . European Union officials say transportation and other logistical problems are holding up some of the massive amounts of humanitarian aid European countries have offered to victims of Hurricane Katrina . In Brussels Tuesday , a spokeswoman for the European Commission said a Swedish plane loaded with food and water treatment tools was ready to take off , but had not received approval from Washington to enter U.S. airspace . She said EU authorities have suggested to the Bush administration that aid could flow more easily if it was placed aboard military planes at U.S. air bases in Europe . More than 20 countries have offered emergency aid teams , tents , meals , water and aircraft to help in the massive relief effort . Meanwhile , U.S. officials say all aid flights from abroad will be directed to an Air Force base in Arkansas , before being sent to the devastated U.S. Gulf Coast . The United Nations nuclear agency says it has no information to support a recent media report of an undeclared nuclear facility in Syria . A spokeswoman , Melissa Fleming , for the International Atomic Energy Agency says her agency would investigate any relevant information on the subject . She said the IAEA expects any country with information about nuclear-related activity of another country to provide that information to the IAEA . The New York Times newspaper reported Sunday that an Israeli air strike on Syria last month targeted a partially built nuclear reactor . The article , which cited unidentified U.S. and foreign officials , said the nuclear reactor was modeled on one North Korea used for stockpiling nuclear fuel . U.S. officials said the site was identified by satellite photographs earlier this year . The IAEA says it is in contact with Syrian authorities to verify the authenticity of the report . The United Nations envoy to the Middle East has urged Israel to accept a new Syrian proposal to renew peace talks . Terje Roed-Larsen made the appeal in a meeting with the Israeli parliament 's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee Tuesday . Mr. Roed-Larsen , who visited Damascus last week , said he feels Syria has stretched out , what he called , a genuine hand of peace and Israel should grab the opportunity . Israel leaders have dismissed as insincere Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's offer to resume peace talks without any preconditions . They accuse Syria of harboring groups that want to destroy the Jewish state . Syria and Israel last held peace talks in January 2000 . Colombian authorities say they have captured a wanted drug lord who allegedly led a major ring with his twin brother , who was killed by police earlier this week . Authorities say Miguel Angel Mejia was captured early Friday in the Tolima region , about 100 kilometers west of Bogota . The brother , Victor Manuel Mejia , was killed Tuesday at a farmhouse in the northern state of Antioquia , along with two of his associates . The United States had offered a $ 5 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of each of the brothers . The two allegedly ran illegal drugs into the United States via Mexico . Authorities say the brothers were also members of a right-wing paramilitary group that demobilized in recent years as part of a peace deal with the government . But the twins went on the run instead of turning themselves in as part of the deal . The family of Brad Delp says his death was a suicide . The 55-year-old Delp , who sang in the multi-million-selling rock band Boston , was found March 9 by his fiancee at his home in the northeastern state of New Hampshire . Toxicology tests by the state medical examiner 's office confirmed he committed suicide by sealing himself inside a bathroom with two charcoal grills . He died from carbon monoxide poisoning . Delp left two notes taped to a door , along with letters to his family and his fiancee , Pamela Sullivan . A police representative says the contents of the letters are not known . Brad Delp 's family is reportedly planning a public memorial . John Garang South Sudan 's leader John Garang says his former rebel group is ready to deploy up to 12000 troops in war-torn west Sudan 's Darfur region to help displaced people return to their villages . In an interview with VOA in Washington Wednesday , Mr. Garang said his Sudan People Liberation Army ( SPLA ) would be deployed alongside African Union troops . The two-and-half year conflict in Darfur between mainly local rebels and pro-government militias has killed 1,80,000 people and displaced about two million others . Mr. Garang 's rebel group and the Sudanese government in Khartoum signed a peace accord in January ending more than 20 years of civil war . Under the accord Mr. Garang becomes first vice president of Sudan 's national government . Isolated grass fires continue to burn in the southern U.S. states of Oklahoma and Texas , but they have weakened since killing one elderly woman and scorching dozens of homes on Tuesday . Officials said decreased winds and slightly cooler temperatures have helped firefighters contain the blazes . But there are worries that continuing drought conditions could lead to new fires . The initial fires are being blamed on children playing with fireworks or people being careless with discarded cigarettes . On Tuesday , Texas governor Rick Perry dispatched National Guard troops to help battle the blazes and declared the fires a disaster . U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney has left Singapore after his plane underwent repairs for a minor mechanical problem . U.S. officials say Cheney 's plane made a scheduled stop Sunday at Singapore 's Paya Lebar Air Base to refuel . While there , the plane underwent repairs for a minor electrical problem . Officials did not describe the problem but said it was not a safety concern and had not affected flight plans . Earlier , Australian Prime Minister John Howard had said Cheney 's plane was diverted to Singapore because of unspecified problems . Cheney traveled to Singapore from Australia , where he held talks with Mr. Howard and opposition leader Kevin Rudd . Earlier in the week , Cheney visited Japan and the U.S. Pacific island of Guam to discuss regional security issues , and rally support for the Iraq war . French authorities have announced April 22 , 2007 , as the date for the first round of the country 's presidential election , with a run-off if needed on May 6 . Officials say voting for a new National Assembly , the lower house of parliament , will be held June 10 and June 17 . Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be the presidential candidate of the ruling Union for a Popular Movement . The front-runner for the Socialist nomination is Segolene Royal , head of the Poitou-Charentes region in western France . The term of incumbent President Jacques Chirac expires in May . The French leader , who has been in office since 1995 , has not announced whether he plans to seek re-election . But most analysts do not believe he will seek another term . Burmese officials have defended the recent 800 percent increase in fuel prices , saying the hike is a reasonable move to keep pace with world oil prices . The overnight increase last week raised prices for gasoline from less than four cents per liter to more than 30 cents per liter . The rate is still much lower than many other countries , but is relatively expensive for Burmese consumers . Burma 's information minister Brigadier General Kyaw Hsann said the government has been subsidizing gasoline at a loss for years . Reports indicate prices on everyday goods have jumped following the gas price hike . The information minister denied the rise was linked to fuel prices , blaming the increase on what he called greedy business people . The largest U.S. supplier of parts for the automotive industry has filed for bankruptcy protection . Delphi Corporation filed a motion with the federal bankruptcy court in New York Saturday to reorganize its U.S. operations . Delphi , which split off from its former parent , General Motors , six years ago , recently failed to win financial concessions from unions . The company 's chairman and chief executive officer , Robert Miller , told the Associated Press he hopes Delphi can emerge from bankruptcy protection within two years . He said the firm will continue to negotiate with General Motors and its unions to lower labor costs . Delphi lost nearly $ 5 billion in 2004 and $ 750 million in the first half of this year . It has a reported debt load of $ 6 billion . Former U.S. President Bill Clinton has checked into a New~York hospital in preparation for more surgery Thursday , this time to remove fluid and scar tissue from his left chest cavity . Mr. Clinton said Wednesday he is not worried about his condition , a complication that doctors have described as uncommon but not high risk . Surgeons will drain fluid that has accumulated around the former president 's left lung after his quadruple heart bypass operation last September . He is expected to be in the hospital for three to 10 days , but doctors say they expect a full recovery . The 58-year-old Mr. Clinton spent the day before his surgery playing in a charity golf tournament for tsunami relief in the southeastern state of Florida . He has told reporters he feels fine despite the condition , which causes some shortness of breath . Kuwait has found the deadly H5N1 variety of avian flu in one of two infected birds culled by authorities . The strain was found in a migrating flamingo , while a second , imported bird had the milder H5N2 variant . Later Friday , Thai officials said a one-year-old boy in Bangkok has been diagnosed with the virulent H5N1 strain , but is expected to fully recover . Meanwhile , Vietnam says it will set up a medical facility for Cambodian bird flu patients near the border between the two countries in an effort to contain the spread of the virus . Health officials said the small ward will mean Cambodian patients do not have to travel more deeply into Vietnam for treatment . And on Thursday , China reported another outbreak of bird flu in a flock of chickens in northeastern Liaoning province , the country 's seventh outbreak in a month . The sentencing phase begins Tuesday for Army Private Lynndie England , who was convicted of abusing detainees at Iraq 's Abu Ghraib prison . On Monday , a military jury in Fort Hood , Texas , found her guilty of maltreating detainees , committing an indecent act , and conspiracy . She faces up to 10 years in prison . England became a central figure in the scandal after photographs emerged of her humiliating prisoners . She is seen grinning , and in one picture , holding a leash around the neck of a naked prisoner . Her lawyers argued she is overly compliant and was easily controlled by the accused ringleader of the abuse , then-Specialist Charles Graner , who is now serving a 10-year prison sentence . Early this year , England pleaded guilty to abuse charges as part of a plea bargain , but a judge later canceled the deal and ordered the case to trial . Nepal 's main political parties say they are ready to hold talks with Maoists on forming a broad front against King Gyanendra , provided the rebels stop killing civilians . A member of the main Nepali Congress party told reporters the parties will set up a team for talks with the rebels . But , he said , no date has been fixed . He said human rights groups and activists would be asked to monitor whether the rebels had ended their attacks on civilians before any dialogue is held . The decision by the seven parties came after Maoist leader Prachanda last month agreed to key conditions set by them . Prachanda promised that the rebels would stop extortion and also targeting unarmed civilians . There has been no reaction by the royalist government , which describes the rebels as terrorists . Mexican authorities have discovered the decapitated bodies of 12 men , including some believed to be soldiers , in the southern state of Guerrero . Earlier media reported there were nine bodies found in and around the state capital , Chilpancingo . Authorities said the heads of the men were found in plastic bags in a separate , nearby location . Authorities found a sign near some of the bodies that read : " For every one of mine that you kill , I will kill 10 . " Mexico is caught in a rising wave of violence as drug cartels battle for territory and fight a nationwide crackdown led by President Felipe Calderon , who has deployed tens of thousands of troops and federal police across Mexico to try to stop the violence . Police say the cartels are battling for control of smuggling routes into the United States . There have been nearly 5400 drug-related homicides across Mexico this year . The U.S. military says a soldier is being held in Iraq for allegedly killing two other American servicemen during an argument . A military statement released Tuesday says Specialist Neftaly Platero was detained after the killing of two soldiers in Fallujah , Iraq , last Thursday . Colonel Barry Johnson says a " verbal altercation " broke out among four soldiers . The military spokesman says Platero allegedly took out his weapon and began shooting at the other soldiers . A third soldier was wounded in the incident . The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says 36 countries are currently dependent on external food aid , and says civil strife and bad weather are primarily to blame . The organization says the majority of dependent countries continue to be in Africa , where 23 states rely on food assistance from abroad . In its report , the U.N. agency warns that conflict and drought in the troubled Sudanese region of Darfur will most likely lead to a below-average harvest . The organization warned of diminishing crops in Eritrea and Kenya , and says below-normal rainfall in southern Africa could adversely affect Zimbabwe , Lesotho , and Swaziland The report also says the food situation remains critical in the west African country of Mauritania , and says the conflict in Ivory Coast is disrupting agriculture and market activities there . A senior aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Saturday Mr. Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will meet Monday in the West Bank town of Jericho . The announcement comes less than a week after U.S. Secretary of State Condolezza Rice met separately with each leader and called for a deeper dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians . Mr. Abbas and Mr. Olmert have held periodic meetings in recent months . Abbas aide Nabil Amr says this week 's meeting is an opportunity for both sides to make progress on key areas ahead of an international peace conference proposed for later this year in the United States . Rice said during her trip to the region last week the international conference could " advance Palestinian statehood . " Zambia 's deputy leader says President Levy Mwanawasa has undergone minor surgery in France to improve his breathing . Zambian Vice President Rupiah Banda says Tuesday the president is in stable condition following the operation which took place Monday afternoon . Mr. Mwanawasa suffered a stroke during a visit to Egypt on June 29 and was transferred to a Paris military hospital last week for treatment . Mr. Mwanawasa is 59 years old and has served as Zambian president since 2002 . He suffered a mild stroke in 2006 before being re-elected that year . Mr. Mwanawasa also is the leader of the Southern African Development Community . Organizers of this week 's British Grand Prix Formula One race say that the competition will go ahead as scheduled despite Thursday 's bombings in Central London . Race organizers said in a statement that the Silverstone course has a well-established set of security measures that have been planned in detail with police and other agencies . The statement said that organizers are confident the security is adequate to ensure the safety of all attending the race Sunday . Practice for the race is Friday with qualifying on Saturday . The event was disrupted two years ago when a kilted protester ran onto the track during the race . The number two leader of the al-Qaida terror network has urged Muslims to oppose a referendum proposed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas . Ayman al-Zawahiri made the statement in a videotape aired Friday by the Arabic television network al-Jazeera . He said Palestine is a house of Islam and not subject to any compromise . Mr. Abbas has proposed to hold a referendum on a Palestinian statehood plan that recognizes Israel . Mr. Abbas of the Fatah party has given the militant group Hamas until the end of the week to agree to the statehood plan or he will call the referendum . Mr. Abbas has been in a power struggle with Hamas since the militant group took control of the Palestinian Authority earlier this year . Former Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva was sworn-in Thursday as the country 's first center-right president in 32 years . A number of foreign dignitaries attended the inauguration , including former U.S. President George H.W. Bush . Mr. Cavaco Silva has promised to revitalize Portugal 's economy . He says he is entirely ready to cooperate with the ruling Socialists to achieve his goals . The country has been suffering with high unemployment and less than one percent economic growth . The Portuguese president has no executive powers , but does have the authority to dissolve parliament , appoint prime ministers , and veto laws . Mr. Cavaco Silva was elected in January . He is Portugal 's first conservative president since the country became a democracy in 1974 . A report in Sunday 's New York Times says the Bush administration may have tried to influence Iraq 's January elections by covertly supporting certain political parties . The report cites an article written by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh that will appear in the coming issue of The New Yorker magazine . Mr. Hersh asserts the administration proceeded with the plan despite Congressional objections . A National Security Council spokesman told the New York Times that , in the end , the president decided not to help individual candidates for Iraqi office . As the newspaper noted , the response did not make clear whether certain parties were helped . The spokesman added that White House officials were concerned about what they saw as extensive Iranian support for pro-Shiite parties . President Bush has repeatedly called for free and fair elections in Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries . Thousands of Africans flocked to churches across the continent to remember Pope John Paul II , as many more gathered around televisions to watch his funeral in Rome . Several African states declared Friday a national holiday or a day of national mourning for the pope . State television broadcast the funeral live in countries such as Nigeria , South Africa , Ivory Coast and the Democratic Republic of Congo . In the capital of the Republic of Congo , Brazzaville , a giant television screen was set up for those without one at home . Officials in Madagascar say people gathered in town halls where the funeral was being shown on television powered by generators . Africans praised Pope John Paul II for his efforts to help the poor and promote peace during many trips to the continent , which now has one of the fastest growing Roman Catholic populations in the world . Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has announced plans for a summit with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on June 21 in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm al-Sheikh . A statement from the Israeli prime minister on Wednesday said officials from both sides will hold talks before the summit to discuss an ongoing truce and Israel 's planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in August . Separately , Israeli police say they have arrested five members of the Islamic Jihad militant group who they said were planning to carry out a bomb attack in Jerusalem on Thursday . Also the Israeli parliament was expected to hold a debate late Wednesday on plans to demolish the homes of nearly 90 Arab families in East Jerusalem to make room for a national park . Palestinian officials have criticized the plan . The terrorist group al-Qaida in Iraq has criticized the country 's moderate Sunni Arabs for taking part in last month 's parliamentary elections and called on them to abandon electoral politics . The remark came in an audio tape posted on an Islamist web site Sunday . The speaker sounded like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , but the authenticity of the tape could not be verified . In the tape , he denounced the Iraqi Islamic Party for endorsing a new constitution , and said the largest Sunni Arab party should not be involved in reconciliation because it will lead to the destruction of the Sunni community . Zarqawi said his group could have disrupted the December 15 balloting , but did not want to harm the Sunni people . He also criticized Arab countries that met in Cairo in November to seek reconciliation between Iraq 's political factions . He said those countries were out to destroy Iraq and cooperate with America . Egyptian authorities have tentatively identified the remains of one of the bombers who struck a Red Sea resort on Saturday , killing scores of people . Security sources say they believe a known Sinai militant , Youssef Badran , was at the wheel of a vehicle that exploded in front of a hotel . Authorities were performing DNA tests Tuesday to confirm the identity . Egyptian sources say police have been looking for links between Saturday 's attacks and two Sinai bombings last year that killed 34 people . The possible links surfaced after two militant groups claiming credit for Saturday 's attack said they also carried out bombings last October near a resort in Taba . Meanwhile , the Egyptian Health Ministry says 64 people died in the blasts , while local doctors say they account for 88 fatalities . Several reports quote hospitals as saying the ministry count excludes some sets of body parts . Iraq 's foreign minister says Syria is refusing to stop insurgents and foreign fighters from entering Iraq . Hoshyar Zebari told the Associated Press Thursday Syria and other authoritarian governments in the region are frightened of Iraq 's efforts to build a democratic nation in the heart of the Middle East and want to see it fail . The Iraqi foreign minister said these governments are not helping stem the flow of foreign fighters and weapons into Iraq , despite pledges to do so . Syria 's U.N. Ambassador Fayssal Mekdad insisted Wednesday that his country has been cooperating with Iraq by deploying 10000 troops on the border , erecting barriers and arresting hundreds of potential infiltrators . Earlier this month , President Bush said Syria faces growing international isolation because of what he calls its failure to stop fighters from crossing its border into Iraq . Burma 's military government has blamed ethnic Karen rebels for a land mine explosion that killed two people and wounded 11 others in the country 's east . Burmese state media said a passenger bus hit the explosive last Sunday as it was traveling in Karen State about 200 kilometers from Rangoon . The reports said the junta blamed the Karen National Union for the blast . It was not immediately clear why the incident was reported only Saturday - nearly a week later . The military has accused the Karen National Union of responsibility for a series of bombings in recent months , including a December blast in Karen state that killed seven people . The Karen National Union has been fighting for greater autonomy for ethnic Karen people in Burma for more than 60 years . Traditional fishermen in poor countries around the world face tough competition from international industrial fishing operations . In the fishing-rich West African nation of Guinea , there are laws meant to preserve some waters for the local fishermen . But a lack of money means these laws often are not enforced . Kari Barber reports from Conakry that many traditional fishermen feel they are being squeezed out of their livelihoods . President Bush will pay tribute at a Memorial Day ceremony later Monday at Arlington National Cemetery to members of America 's military who died in combat . Mr. Bush will make remarks and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns which contains the remains of unidentified U.S. service members who died in World Wars I and II - and in the Korean War . On Sunday thousands of motorcycle riders conducted a parade through downtown Washington to honor missing soldiers and prisoners of war . In the United States , the Memorial Day holiday marks the unofficial start of summer , and is an occassion for picnics and parties as well as for observances at military cemeteries around the country . A key U.S. congressional panel has approved legislation to reform the American health care system . The House of Representatives ' Energy and Commerce committee voted 31 to 28 late Friday to back a measure aimed at extending health insurance to Americans not now covered . Congress is about to adjourn for an August recess . But now that the committee has approved the bill , it can move to the full House as early as September . A major part of the legislation involves creating a public health insurance plan . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - a Democrat - says the changes will stop the insurance industry from coming between doctors and patients . But minority Republicans say the proposal costs too much and is the first step toward a government takeover of health care . Bangladeshi authorities have slaughtered nearly 20000 chickens after bird flu was detected at a government-run poultry farm . Officials Tuesday said the latest infection of the potentially deadly H5N1 virus occurred at the farm in Mirpur , just outside Bangladesh 's capital , Dhaka . The bird flu was first detected in Bangladesh in March of 2007 at a state-owned poultry farm . Since then , the government has slaughtered more than 3,00,000 chickens . No human cases of infection have been reported so far . Officials say Bangladesh has about 1,50,000 poultry farms , with an annual turnover of $ 750 million . Russia says it agrees with the United States that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons , but Moscow sees no reason to refer Tehran to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions . Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the comment Saturday , after talks in Moscow with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . Mr. Lavrov said the issue should be handled within the International Atomic Energy Agency . But Secretary Rice insisted that the Security Council option remains open if Iran fails to agree to negotiations on its nuclear program . Iran denies U.S. and European accusations that it is secretly trying to develop atomic weapons . Secretary Rice later met with Russian President Vladimir Putin , who praised the success of her trip through five Asian countries . She stops in Britain before returning home . The U.S. attorney general has defended the use of sting operations against suspected terrorists during a speech to a Muslim rights group . Eric Holder told Muslim Advocates that such operations are essential to identifying and preventing terror attacks on all citizens . The California-based group had expressed concern that Justice Department tactics bordered on entrapment in some cases . During his speech , Holder defended a case last month , in which a Somali-born man in Oregon was arrested after trying to detonate what he thought was a bomb near Christmas tree lighting . Undercover FBI agents provided the suspect with the fake bomb . The director of the Muslim Advocates says it still has concerns and that fairness should be the cornerstone of each probe . Ukraine 's foreign minister says the Commonwealth of Independent States has no future in its present form but indicated his country is not planning to quit the organization that groups 12 former Soviet republics . Boris Tarasyuk told reporters in Kiev Tuesday that the commonwealth , long criticized for being dominated by Russia , has become stagnant . Georgia has said it is considering quitting the group . Ukrainian authorities are currently preparing for a summit Monday of leaders from another grouping of former Soviet republics known as GUAM , a group that brings together Georgia , Ukraine , Azerbaijan and Moldova . Tarasyuk says one purpose of next week 's meeting is to strengthen and reorganize the smaller group , which , he said , could bring in other countries . An Israeli security guard has shot dead a Palestinian man in Jerusalem 's Old City after the Palestinian grabbed a gun from another Israeli guard and opened fire . Israeli police say the gunfight Friday began when the Palestinian snatched a gun from an Israeli guard outside a Jewish seminary in the Old City 's Christian quarter . They say the attacker , roughly 20 years old , shot and wounded the guard and fled . Another Israeli guard chased the Palestinian and shot him dead after a brief exchange of fire . Ten bystanders also were wounded by the gunfire . Several witnesses say the Israeli guard kept shooting after the attacker fell to the ground . Israeli police say the security guard acted appropriately in response to a terrorist incident . In May , Israeli security forces killed two Palestinian gunmen who opened fire in an Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem . Two Israeli officers were wounded in that attack . The former U.S. administrator for Iraq has praised Sunday 's election as a victory for democracy , and says it has proved skeptics wrong . Speaking on American television ( NBC 's Today Show ) Monday , Paul Bremer said the election was a great victory for the Iraqi people , for democracy and for President Bush 's message of freedom . Mr. Bremer said it is a mark of the resilience and courage of the Iraqi people that they have come this far . But he added that despite the apparent success of the vote , he expects more violence ahead . Mr. Bremer also expressed optimism that Iraq would not fracture along ethnic and religious lines , and that the Sunni minority , which appears to have largely boycotted the vote , would have a voice in the new government . Security sources in Yemen say tribesmen have blown up an oil pipeline in retaliation for raids targeting al-Qaida sympathizers . Officials say tribesman in eastern Maarib province sabotaged the pipeline Saturday , after government forces raided the homes of tribal leaders thought to be harboring al-Qaida operatives . On Wednesday , more than 20 people were wounded when security forces clashed with tribesmen in eastern Yemen during the operation to apprehend Hassan al-Aqili . Aqili is wanted for the death of a senior army officer , killed in an ambush last Saturday . Reigning champion Canada defeated Italy , 42773 , while Sweden defeated Kazakhstan , 42773 , in first-round action at the Olympic men 's ice hockey tournament in Turin . Canada scored five consecutive goals in the second period after Italy had tied the Group-A game 42736 . Jarome Iginla , Dany Heatley , Shane Doan , Martin St. Louis and Brad Richards all scored for Canada . Meanwhile in Group-B , Daniel Tjarnqvist scored twice while brothers Daniel and Henrik Sedin had one goal each to lead Sweden past Kazakhstan in their first-round game . Later games have Finland against Switzerland , Germany playing the Czech Republic , Russia taking on Slovakia , and the United States against Latvia . China says it will deploy unmanned aircraft or drones over its Olympic sailing venue in the coastal city of Qingdao during the Beijing Games to watch for suspicious activities . The state-run Xinhua news agency says police tested one of the drones Friday during a drill in the Shandong provincial capital of Jinan , not far from Qingdao . Reports say it is the first time that China has used the unmanned , low-flying reconnaissance aircraft . Xinhua says the drones will scout out suspicious activity and transmit photos and video back to a command station . It did not say what threats the sailing event could face . China has said terrorism is the biggest threat to the Beijing games and already claims to have foiled terrorist plots targeting athletes and foreigners during the Olympics . Iran 's chief religious leader is urging Arab nations to boycott an upcoming U.S.-hosted peace conference . Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued the call Saturday during a sermon in Tehran . The conference next month is aimed at resolving the issue of Palestinian statehood , but Ayatollah Khamenei says the real goal is to prop up Israel , which he called the " Zionist regime . " The cleric says previous peace conferences have been at the expense of the Palestinian people . He questioned the need for Arab states to attend the forum , since the Palestinians themselves are not taking part . He did not mention talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , preparing for the conference . In Saturday 's sermon , the ayatollah also blamed the United States for the chaos in Iraq . Police in Afghanistan say Afghan and NATO forces have killed 18 Taleban rebels in clashes in the country 's volatile southern region . The fighting took place Tuesday near the village of Garmser in Helmand province . There were no casualties reported among the NATO and Afghan troops . Also on Tuesday , three British soldiers were killed in the same province when suspected Taleban insurgents ambushed a NATO patrol . NATO took over security operations this week from U.S.-led coalition forces in six southern Afghan provinces . A car exploded just outside Afghanistan 's capital , Kabul , killing one person in the vehicle Wednesday , and wounding at least two others . Police say they are not sure if the blast was a suicide attack . At least one of the people injured was in the vehicle at the time of the explosion . Colombian authorities say leftist rebels have attacked a military convoy in southern Colombia with explosives , killing 10 servicemen . A military commander says the attack was carried out by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) in Putumayo state , one of Colombia 's biggest cocaine-producing regions . The FARC , along with a smaller rebel group and rightist paramilitaries , is locked in a long-running war with the government that leaves thousands of people dead each year . Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade , offshore banking , and its position as an international conference center . Tax rates are low to attract foreign investment . The British military presence has been sharply reduced and now contributes about 7 % to the local economy , compared with 60 % in 1984 . The financial sector , tourism ( almost 5 million visitors in 1998 ) , gaming revenues , shipping services fees , and duties on consumer goods also generate revenue . The financial sector , tourism , and the shipping sector contribute 30 % , 30 % , and 25 % , respectively , of GDP . Telecommunications , e-commerce , and e-gaming account for the remaining 15 % . In recent years , Gibraltar has seen major structural change from a public to a private sector economy , but changes in government spending still have a major impact on the level of employment . Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the middle of the 10th century . Its golden age occurred in the 16th century . During the following century , the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation . In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 , Russia , Prussia , and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves . Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II . It became a Soviet satellite state following the war , but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive . Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union " Solidarity " that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency . A " shock therapy " program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe , but Poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment , underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure , and a poor rural underclass . Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004 . With its transformation to a democratic , market-oriented country largely completed , Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations . This thoroughly modern market economy features a high-tech agricultural sector , state-of-the-art industry with world-leading firms in pharmaceuticals , maritime shipping and renewable energy , and a high dependence on foreign trade . Denmark is a member of the European Union ( EU ) ; Danish legislation and regulations conform to EU standards on almost all issues . Danes enjoy among the highest standards of living in the world and the Danish economy is characterized by extensive government welfare measures and an equitable distribution of income . Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus , but depends on imports of raw materials for the manufacturing sector . Within the EU , Denmark is among the strongest supporters of trade liberalization . After a long consumption-driven upswing , Denmark 's economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing boom . Housing prices dropped markedly in 2008 - 9 . The global financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through increased borrowing costs and lower export demand , consumer confidence , and investment . The global financial crises cut Danish GDP by 0.9 % in 2008 and 5.2 % in 2009 . Historically low levels of unemployment rose sharply with the recession but remain below 5 % , based on the national measure , about half the level of the EU ; harmonized to OECD standards the unemployment rate was about 8 % at the end of 2010 . Denmark made a modest recovery in 2010 in part because of increased government spending . An impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major long-term issue . Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to 2008 , but the budget balance swung into deficit during 2009 - 10 . Nonetheless , Denmark 's fiscal position remains among the strongest in the EU . Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , so far Denmark has decided not to join , although the Danish krone remains pegged to the euro . The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second largest in the world - was divided between Germany ( north ) and the UK ( south ) in 1885 . The latter area was transferred to Australia in 1902 , which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued to administer the combined areas until independence in 1975 . A nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville ended in 1997 after claiming some 20000 lives . The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in the 1890s . Some of the most bitter fighting of World War II occurred on this archipelago . Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later . Ethnic violence , government malfeasance , and endemic crime have undermined stability and civil society . In June 2003 , then Prime Minister Sir Allan KEMAKEZA sought the assistance of Australia in reestablishing law and order ; the following month , an Australian-led multinational force arrived to restore peace and disarm ethnic militias . The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands ( RAMSI ) has generally been effective in restoring law and order and rebuilding government institutions . THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because , while she was green all the year round , the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons . A shower of snow fell upon them , and , finding the Olive full of foliage , it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight , at once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree . But finding the Fig-Tree denuded of leaves , the snow fell through to the ground , and did not injure it at all . AN Editor who was always vaunting the purity , enterprise , and fearlessness of his paper was pained to observe that he got no subscribers . One day it occurred to him to stop saying that his paper was pure and enterprising and fearless , and make it so . " If these are not good qualities , " he reasoned , " it is folly to claim them . " Under the new policy he got so many subscribers that his rivals endeavoured to discover the secret of his prosperity , but he kept it , and when he died it died with him . On July 8 , 1947 , witnesses claim a spaceship with five aliens aboard crashed on a sheep-and-cattle ranch outside Roswell , an incident they say has been covered up by the military . March 31 , 1948 , nine months after that day , Al Gore was born . That clears up a lot of things . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has rallied hundreds of thousands of supporters in Caracas in advance of the December 3 presidential vote . Mr. Chavez told the crowd Sunday that his goal is not to merely win , but to outdo previous triumphs in a way that is overwhelming and crushing . Polls show Mr. Chavez well ahead of his opponent Manuel Rosales . Mr. Chavez has built strong support in Venezuela for his criticism of the Bush administration and for programs he says will improve the lives of the nation 's poor . Mr. Rosales is the governor of Zulia state . He has criticized Chavez ' ties to Cuba 's Fidel Castro , saying Venezuelans want modernity , not the Cubanization of their country . Mr. Rosales held a campaign rally Saturday that also attracted hundreds of thousands of supporters . Officials say a journalist with state-controlled Russian television was found dead in his Moscow apartment early Friday . Firefighters who came to put out a fire at his apartment found the body of 32-year-old Ilyas Shurpayev . Police said he appeared to have been strangled with a belt and had multiple stab wounds . Shurpayev moved to Moscow from the mostly Muslim Dagestan province and had reported extensively from Russia 's violence-ridden North Caucasus region and neighboring areas of Georgia . More than a dozen journalists have been slain in contract-style killings in Russia since 2000 . Many journalists appear to have been targeted for beatings and killings because of their attempts to report on allegations of official corruption . Iranian state media are reporting that Iran is operating nearly 500 new uranium-enriching centrifuges at its Natanz nuclear facility . The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Friday an unnamed source familiar with the program as saying that the centrifuges are part of 3000 installed last year at the complex . On Tuesday , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced Tehran plans to install 6000 new centrifuges at Natanz . Meanwhile , a senior Iranian nuclear official denied Iran is having technical difficulties in expanding its nuclear activities . Iran currently faces three sets of United Nations Security Council sanctions and international isolation for its refusal to halt uranium enrichment , which can be used in building nuclear weapons . The United States has accused Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes . Authorities in Afghanistan say four policemen were killed and four others wounded by militants who attacked a security checkpoint in southern Kandahar province . Police say one militant also was killed during the assault - a drive-by shooting - late Sunday in Maywand district , west of Kandahar city . Less than 24 hours earlier , two U.S. soldiers were wounded in an attack on their patrol in southern Zabul province . Two weeks ago , American and Afghan forces launched a winter offensive , dubbed " Operation Lightning Freedom " , to hunt for Taleban militants ahead of planned parliamentary elections next year . The operation is aimed at strengthening security to ensure that the parliamentary election , in about four months , can be conducted as smoothly as Afghanistan 's landmark presidential ballot in October . Australian Prime Minister John Howard says his government has received information about a specific terror threat against the country . Mr. Howard told a news conference Wednesday , the government received information this week that caused " serious concern . " He would not provide details . The prime minister said he would try to push new anti-terror legislation through parliament Wednesday , to help law enforcement agencies fight the threat . Counter-terrorism laws under consideration in Australia would allow suspects to be electronically watched or held in custody for up to 14 days without charge . They would also create tighter checks on citizenship applicants and authorize jail terms for inciting violence . Rights organizations have criticized the measures , saying they threaten civil liberties and violate international law . U.S. Senate investigators say the former head of the U.N. oil-for-food program for Iraq may have netted more than $ 1 million through oil deals with Saddam Hussein 's government . A Senate panel has released Iraqi Oil Ministry documents that suggest program chief Benon Sevan was given the right to sell Iraqi oil contracts . The panel began hearings Tuesday on allegations of corruption in the now-defunct United Nations-run program . A U.N. commission headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker is conducting a separate investigation into whether Mr. Sevan received money through the program . The commission 's preliminary report said Mr. Sevan solicited oil deals for a Panamanian company , an act the commission called a " conflict of interest . " Mr. Sevan has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing . The death toll from a gas explosion at a Chinese coal mine has climbed to 87 , with rescuers still searching for 21 miners . Officials with the local coal mine safety bureau said Friday that gas density in the mine is so high it makes rescue efforts dangerous . The latest explosion happened Wednesday at the Liuguantun mine near Tangshan city in Hebei province . Only 30 miners are known to have survived the blast . China 's mines are the deadliest in the world . Thousands of miners are killed each year . On Tuesday , rescuers recovered the body of the last miner missing in a November 27 coal dust explosion in Heilongjiang province , bringing the number of deaths in that blast to 171 . China 's Xinhua news agency reports the top Communist Party official in a northern Chinese city and 26 other officials have gone on trial for their alleged involvement in a deadly attack on a shantytown . More than 200 people attended the opening of the trial in Hebei province . The news agency says last June , hundreds of apparently hired thugs armed with guns , clubs and knives killed six people and injured dozens of others protesting land seizures in the village of Shengyou . Villagers were angry over the low compensation officials offered for their land . Such disputes have become more common as Chinese developers turn residential and farm land into shopping malls , apartment buildings and other projects . Residents often accuse authorities of forcing them off land without proper compensation . The author of new book about Burmese military ruler Than Shwe describes the general as smarter and better informed than most people realize , but also ruthless and adept at manipulating others . During interviews promoting the book , entitled Unmasking Than Shwe , British journalist Benedict Rogers said he relied on conversations with Burmese military defectors and foreign diplomats to gain an insight into one of the world 's most secretive leaders . Rogers says Than Shwe 's reputed interest in astrology should not lead outsiders to underestimate him . He said the general is an astute judge of people and trained in psychological warfare , making him an expert at divide-and-rule tactics . The author says no one should believe that planned elections this year will loosen Than Shwe 's grip on power . Rogers also says the actions documented in his book provide ample grounds for Than Shwe to be brought to trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity . Israel has re-opened its border crossings with the Gaza Strip . Military spokesman Peter Lerner says the Sufa , Karni and the Nahal Oz crossings opened Wednesday . He said cement shipments will delivered for the first time in a year into the Gaza Strip . The border crossings were closed on Tuesday in response to a rocket attack on southern Israel on Monday . There were no causalities in the incident . Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert Tuesday warned Palestinian militants that Israel will respond militarily if they continue attacks from the Gaza Strip in violation of a truce . He said Israel 's restraint in the face of rocket attacks up to now should not be interpreted as a weakness . South African health officials say they have confirmed six new cases of a deadly and extremely drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis . The officials Wednesday said five of the patients diagnosed with so-called XDR-TB are from Gauteng province , which includes Johannesburg . A spokesman said three of the patients have been hospitalized , while authorities try to track down the other three . The find has fueled fears the strain may be spreading . A recent outbreak in South Africa 's Kwazulu-Natal province killed at least 55 people . South African Health Minister Mento Tshabalala-Msimang has requested an urgent meeting with the World Health Organization to deal with the outbreak . The world health body has warned that XDR-TB is a virulent form of tuberculosis resistant to most , perhaps all of the drugs used to treat it . Arsonists burned down an Afghan school for boys and girls in Kandahar early Sunday after another school was saved from the same fate in another part of the city . A local education official , provincial education chief Hayabullah Rafiqi , blames both incidents on Islamic insurgents . At least two school workers were rescued from the Qabail Primary School before it burned down Sunday . The education official says that attack came hours after gunmen tried to set fire to another school in Kandahar , but its guards scared away the suspected Taleban arsonists . The Taleban is against educating women or sending them for work outside the house . There has been a spate of attacks on schools that accept girls across Afghanistan since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taleban in 2001 . Chinese President Hu Jintao marked New Year 's Eve Saturday with a speech stressing the country 's commitment to peaceful development . In a speech broadcast on China Central Television , Mr. Hu said China 's development is peaceful , open , cooperative and harmonious . He said the Chinese people will strive for world peace through their own development . The Chinese leader offered New Year 's greetings to people in Taiwan , and said Beijing would seek peaceful reunification with the island , which China regards as a rogue territory . He added that China would never sway from the " one China " principle . Afghan officials say a mass grave discovered in eastern Afghanistan is thought to contain the bodies of more than 500 soldiers of the communist regime that was toppled in 1992 . Interior Ministry spokesman Yousuf Stanizai says the grave was discovered in Paktika and a team has been sent there to investigate . He said there are reports that more than 500 bodies are in the grave . Officials believe they were defeated soldiers of Soviet-backed President Najibullah , who were killed after they surrendered to the mujahedin fighters . Mr. Najibullah was executed later by the Taleban in 1996 . If proven TRUE , it would be the first mass grave found in Afghanistan containing communist soldiers . Other graves have been found with the bodies of thousands of anti-communist mujahedin fighters . French rally driver Sebastien Loeb has continued his dominance of the Rally of Turkey , stretching his lead to more than one minute after the second day of the event . Loeb , in a Citroen , expanded his lead to 1.16 minutes over Subaru driver Petter Solberg of Norway . Former world champion Marcus Gronholm of Finland in a Peugeot is third overall , 1.24 behind Loeb . Mitsubishi 's Gigi Galli of Italy , who briefly led the rally Friday , dropped to ninth place after suffering a turbo charger malfunction in the 10th stage . Loeb now has a total time of 0.0239953703703704 hours . The French driver leads the season standings with 45 points . Petter Solberg and Markko Martin of Estonia are tied for second with 34 points . Spain 's Interior Minister Jose Antonio Alonso says Croatian war crimes suspect General Ante Gotovina will be extradited to the United Nations tribunal in The Hague as soon possible . He did not specify a time , but police officials say they expect it to take place early Saturday . Police arrested General Gotovina in Spain 's Canary Islands Wednesday . The tribunal indicted him in 2001 for the deaths of 150 civilians in a Serb-held region of Croatia in 1995 . The arrest has increased pressure on Serbia to capture the tribunal 's most wanted suspects , former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military commander General Ratko Mladic . Serbian authorities Friday turned over to U.N. prosecutors a secret file on General Mladic , including a number of pages they earlier had withheld . In Belgrade , visiting French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy urged Serbian officials to arrest and surrender the two fugitives . Western security officials in Afghanistan say searchers have found the wreckage of an Afghan passenger jet missing since Thursday . Security officials say the Kam Air Boeing 737 was found Friday near Kabul , the Afghan capital . It was not immediately clear if any survivors were found . Airline officials say the plane was carrying 104 people , including a number of foreigners . Nine of the passengers are believed to be Turkish nationals , and three were American women working for a health services agency . Six Russian crew members and two Afghan staff were also on board . The plane was traveling from the western city of Herat to Kabul , but was turned away from the capital 's airport because of a severe snow storm . Officials say the pilot had contacted an airport in neighboring Pakistan seeking permission to land , but that the plane never arrived there . Thousands of demonstrators have marched in Oaxaca , Mexico , to continue their call for the resignation of the state 's governor . A student was wounded Sunday when a gunmen fired on a group of protesters . Thousands of protesters marched through the city center and gathered near Mexican federal police -- who were sent to restore order in Oaxaca . Police searched vehicles for weapons . For the past five months , protesters have demanded the resignation of Oaxaca State Governor Ulises Ruiz over corruption allegations . Ruiz has refused to step down . On Wednesday , police re-opened a central square in the city after clearing out protesters . At least nine people , including a U.S. journalist , have been killed in the crisis in recent weeks . Chinese authorities are being ordered to prepare for new flooding as the death toll from weeks of weather-related disasters continues to rise . The official Xinhua news agency said Monday that two more periods of heavy rainfall are forecast across China . It said local authorities have been instructed to evacuate residents from high-risk areas and set up emergency shelters well in advance . More than 2300 people have died across China in weeks of flooding and mudslides triggered by torrential rains . The toll now stands at 1254 dead in Zhouqu , a town in northwest Gansu province that was partly buried by mud a week ago . A town official told the French news agency that roads to the town are still clogged with mud , hampering relief efforts . Gunmen killed at least 31 people in Pakistan 's southern port city of Karachi as a by-election was held Sunday to replace a lawmaker murdered earlier this year . The violence broke out Saturday night when gunmen opened fire in several parts of the city ahead of the vote . Police say they have arrested at least 20 suspects in connection with the killings . The election was being held to replace provincial lawmaker Raza Haider from the Muttahida Quami Movement ( MQM ) , who was gunned down in August . The assassination sparked four days of violence that killed at least 85 people . MQM , which largely represents the Urdu-speaking community , and the rival Awami National Party , representing ethnic Pashtuns , blamed each other for the violence . Karachi has been plagued by ethnic and sectarian killings , crime and kidnappings . Ivory Coast 's prime minister says he is " convinced " that new African Union president Denis Sassou-Nguesso will fully support the U.N. peace plan for his country . Charles Konan Banny spoke to reporters Sunday after meeting with the AU and Congolese president in the Republic of Congo 's capital , Brazzaville . Mr. Sassou-Nguesso was named AU president last week after Sudan 's bid to head the 53-nation block failed because of concerns over its human rights record . Mr. Banny heads a transitional government tasked with arranging elections in Ivory Coast , which has been split between rebel-held and government-controlled areas since a 2002 civil war . The United Nations removed some staff from Ivory Coast following attacks on U.N. offices there earlier this month . The attacks were carried out by militant supporters of President Laurent Gbagbo , after U.N.-backed foreign mediators recommended that parliament be dissolved to advance the peace process . The White House has expressed doubts about a Russian proposal for a Middle East peace conference , saying diplomats should focus on Israel 's upcoming Gaza withdrawal . Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested holding such a conference Wednesday after meeting in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . Both Russia and the United States sponsored the Middle East road map peace plan along with the European Union and United Nations . Mr. Putin 's talks in Egypt made him the first Russian leader to visit Cairo in four decades . He then went to Israel for talks Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon before he is to meet Friday with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank . Mr. Putin is the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit Israel . Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko says her government plans to review some 3000 privatizations to ensure they were conducted fairly . The Interfax news agency quotes her as saying Wednesday that the state will get back what was illegally handed over to what she called " private but dishonest hands . " She has already ordered authorities to begin the process of returning the country 's largest steel mill , Kryvorizhstal , to government control . A consortium that included the son-in-law , Viktor Pinchuk , of former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma purchased the complex last year for $ 800 million , far below its estimated market value . Many privatizations in Ukraine took place under questionable circumstances after the fall of the Soviet Union . China says it plans to issue its first ever white paper on the country 's political democracy . China 's official Xinhua news agency said Tuesday that the Information Office of China 's State Council will issue the document Wednesday . The announcement said the white paper will give a detailed account of the " inception , development , contents and principles of the country 's political democracy . " Xinhua said the document will also mention the problems Beijing faces in building democracy . International rights organizations and several countries , including the United States , have criticized Beijing for not speeding the pace of political reform . China rejects the criticism , saying internal affairs should be handled by China 's government and citizens , not outsiders . Iraqi authorities say a roadside bomb struck a police patrol northeast of Baghdad late Wednesday , killing at least two police officers and wounding four others . The explosion occurred in the town of Jalawla in Diyala province . Insurgents frequently target local and international security forces . Turkish media are reporting that two bombs have exploded in the southern Turkish resort city of Antalya , wounding at least six people . Turkey 's Anatolia news agency says the explosions Tuesday were in two different locations , but occurred just minutes apart . One of the bombs was planted in a trash can that exploded as workers were emptying it . Anatolia reports that the second blast also came from a trash can and wounded three people , including a tourist . It is unclear who planted the bombs . Kurdish rebels from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party have recently launched several attacks on Turkish resort towns . Other terrorist attacks in the country have been blamed on Islamic terrorists . Antalya , on Turkey 's Mediterranean coast , is a popular vacation resort . A lingering ankle injury will keep tennis great Andre Agassi from playing in the Australian Open , the first Grand Slam tennis tournament of the season . Agassi 's management company issued a statement in Australia Thursday saying the former Australian Open champion would not play in the event beginning January 16 . The 35-year-old Agassi has also withdrawn from the Kooyong exhibition event next week . Agassi sustained a severe sprain to his left ankle on October 12 while playing racquetball . The injury initially forced his withdrawal from the Tennis Masters Cup in

a draft constitution . Negotiators took a one-day break in talks after missing Monday 's draft deadline . Parliament has voted an extension until midnight August 22 . If there is no document by then , the interim constitution dictates that parliament and the government must be dissolved and new elections held . A pro-U.S.-immigration rally has been held in the same Los Angeles park where a similar rally earlier this month ended in a clash between demonstrators and police . Hundreds of activists gathered in the city 's MacArthur Park Thursday after marching from a church , where they held a meeting . Demonstrators called for fair treatment for 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States . Hours earlier , the Bush administration reached agreement with several U.S. senators on a plan that would provide legal status and a path to citizenship to the immigrants . At a rally on May 1 , riot police fired rubber bullets at demonstrators and beat many of them with batons . Police said they responded

Shi'ites leave the town . The town has a mixed population of Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims . The abductions are the latest in a series of violent incidents throughout the country . A bomb explosion Saturday at a restaurant in Baquba a town north of Baghdad killed up to seven people , including at least two police officers . Meanwhile ,

roadside bomb exploded in Mogadishu Saturday near the convoy of the capital city 's two deputy mayors . The convoy was traveling through northern Mogadishu when the bomb was detonated . A teenage boy was killed , and four government troops were wounded . The deputy mayors narrowly avoided injury . Guerrilla attacks have increased in Mogadishu since government troops allied with Ethiopian forces battled Islamist forces in March and April , killing more than 1000 people . Somalia has been without an effective government since 1991 , when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and then turned against each other . Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin visited

bomber as he tried to flee . Dheere told reporters his convoy was traveling on a road north of the city when the explosion occurred . It is unclear whether the device was a remote-controlled bomb or a grenade . The mayor blames remnants of the Islamic courts movement for the attack . Last Thursday , the convoy of Interim Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi was also attacked while traveling in Mogadishu . No injuries or deaths were reported in that incident . The owner of a Venezuelan pro-opposition television channel has told U.S. media that he has asked for political asylum in the United States . Globovision president Guillermo Zuloaga made the comment Wednesday in an interview with CNN 's Spanish language channel . Zuloaga fled to the U.S. in June after the government in Caracas issued a warrant for his arrest based on fraud charges relating to another business , an auto dealership . Zuloaga denied the charges and said Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ordered his arrest on trumped-up charges . Zuloaga has also denied allegations of involvement in a $ 100-million scheme to assassinate the Venezuelan president . Mr. Chavez has waged a long-running campaign against Globovision . The

Peyton was rushed to a local hospital after the attack and underwent surgery . Hospital officials say she is in stable condition . Witnesses say the attackers opened fire on Ms. Peyton outside her hotel ( Sahafi Hotel ) and fled the scene in a vehicle . A colleague working with her was unhurt in the attack . Ms. Peyton had traveled from her home in South Africa this week to report on a visit by Somalia 's new government to Mogadishu . Somali officials are readying plans to move the new government from its current base in Kenya later this month . Somalia has been without a central government for 14 years , having been ruled by warring factional leaders . An Indian diplomat has been formally charged with spying for India 's longtime rival Pakistan . Officials say Madhuri Gupta was charged Tuesday under the Official Secrets Act . She is alleged to have passed classified information to Pakistan 's intelligence agency . The 53-year-old junior diplomat worked at the press and information wing of the Indian embassy in Islamabad for three years . Gupta was taken into custody in April after being called back to New Delhi on the pretext of consultations . Tensions run deep between India and Pakistan , whose dispute over Kashmir has led to decades of hostility and triggered three wars . China 's central government has formally launched its official Web site . The www.gov.cn site serves as a platform for the central and regional governments to release information and provide some online services . There is also an English-language section with information on recent government news , biographies of officials and information for travelers to the country . China 's official Xinhua news agency quotes the Web site 's editor-in-chief as saying the site works to increase government transparency and prevent " miscommunication " between the government and the people . China 's central government has come under criticism in recent months for moves that tighten control over the Internet . New regulations forbid Internet news sites from publishing information that goes against what the government calls China 's security and public interest . A double suicide attack on a Pakistani military checkpoint near Quetta has killed at least 11 people and wounded several others . Officials say the first bomber detonated explosives Thursday near a line of vehicles waiting at the checkpoint in southwestern Baluchistan province . As people gathered near the wreckage , a second suicide bomber triggered another explosion . Among the dead are five Pakistani soldiers . Baluchistan province experiences regular bombing and shooting attacks , usually blamed on Baluch nationalists battling the central government for more autonomy and a larger share of the region 's oil and natural gas reserves . But suicide attacks are more commonly carried out by pro-Taliban Islamic extremist groups , based north of Baluchistan in Pakistan 's tribal regions . Afghan police say U.S.-led forces have wounded at least six civilians in two separate incidents involving cars that ignored orders to stop . Authorities in eastern Khost province say that , in the first incident late Monday , a newborn baby , her mother and two other women were hurt when soldiers opened fire at their car after the driver failed to stop . Hours later , in the same province , a driver of a truck and a six-year-old boy were injured in a similar incident . Meanwhile , the U.S. military in Afghanistan says Afghan and coalition troops killed five suspected Taleban insurgents Monday in northeastern Kunar province , where they launched a major offensive last week . Some 2500 troops are participating in " Operation Mountain Lion " aimed at disrupting insurgent activities by killing , incapacitating or capturing terrorists operating in the region . The Air Transport Association predicts fewer domestic airline passengers in the U.S. this summer , between June 1 and August 31 . The airline trade group says higher fuel prices and a weak economy have reduced airline carrying capacity which has led to higher ticket prices . Those factors could have an impact on the number of passengers planning to travel in the U.S. during the traditionally busy summer vacation months . VOA 's Mil Arcega reports . Energy ministers of Russia and Ukraine have adjourned until Thursday their talks in Moscow on a huge price hike sought for deliveries by

Ukraine on January 1 if no deal is reached . Ukraine 's Prime Minister Yuriy Yekhanurov has rejected Gazprom 's plans to more than quadruple natural gas prices , calling it an unacceptable move aimed at putting direct economic pressure on Ukraine . Mr. Yekhanurov told officials in Kiev his country will take all necessary legal steps if the dispute is not resolved . Nepal 's Supreme Court has issued a stay-order to temporarily halt the closure of a private radio station that defied a ban on broadcasting news . Judge Anup Raj Sharma issued an interim order on Wednesday requiring Nepal 's royalist government to immediately suspend the closure of Nepal FM radio station . Mr. Sharma also questioned the grounds on which the government closed down the station . Now the station will continue operating until a final ruling by the Supreme Court determines its future . The Ministry of Information and Communication issued a letter requesting the station be shut down because it defied a ban imposed by King Gyanendra . Nepal FM aired programs that included weather forecasts , information on cultural events and government announcements . Afghan police say a suicide bomber has killed at least three people in the south of the country . Local police chief Jawid Ahmad said the bomber was also killed Saturday when he detonated his explosives while riding his motorcycle in the border town of Spin Boldak in Kandahar province . Eight people , including women and children , were wounded in the attack . Spin Boldak is a major crossing point between Afghanistan and Pakistan . Wednesday , a suicide bomber killed at least five security guards escorting a NATO convoy in a similar attack in the area . Syria 's ambassador to the United States says his government will fully withdraw from Lebanon as soon as possible , perhaps in less than two months . Speaking at Georgetown University in Washington , Wednesday Ambassador Imad Moustapha said the timing of the withdrawal will be determined by Syrian and Lebanese military officials , who are set to meet next week . Earlier , U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had agreed to present by early next month a firm timetable for the pullout . Mr. Annan also said he will soon release the findings of the U.N. investigation into the February assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri . But he added that a second probe may be needed . Mr. Annan spoke after news reports said early findings show signs of negligence and possible evidence tampering by Lebanese authorities . Two Egyptian children have tested positive for bird flu , bringing the total number infected in the country to 29 . The health ministry said Tuesday , the two children are from different areas south of Cairo . They were taken to the hospital and both are in stable condition . Sunday , a three-year-old girl from the southern town of Aswan tested positive for the potentially deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu . The girl 's condition is improving . Egypt has the largest number of human cases of bird flu outside Asia . At least 13 people have died since the first confirmed case in the country about a year ago . Thousands of people in the Haitian capital have demonstrated in support of presidential candidate Rene Preval . As election workers continued to tally votes in the close race , demonstrators gathered outside the election commission , with some demanding Preval be declared the winner . But election officials said Saturday that the former president has just over 49 percent of the vote , with about three-quarters of the ballots counted . He needs to win a majority for an outright victory . Another former president , Leslie Manigat , is second with 12 percent . International observers say the election was free and fair and have urged Haitians to respect the outcome . But candidate Charles Baker , who has about eight percent of the vote , has called for an investigation into reports of people voting multiple times . Officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigations say violent

percent . They include cities such as Miami in the southeastern state of Florida , Oakland in the western state of California and Phoenix in the southwestern state of Arizona and New York City , among others . Around the country incidences of forcible rape decreased by nearly two percent . Robbery saw an overall increase of near six

is reached by then , the dialogue is broken . Mr. Zelaya 's proposal would authorize the Honduran Congress to decide whether to reinstate him . The Zelaya camp rejected a proposal by Interim President Roberto Micheletti calling for the Supreme Court to make the decision . The ousted leader 's chief negotiator called the proposal " absurd . " Mr. Micheletti has been under intense international pressure to restore Mr. Zelaya , since he was removed from power in a June 28 coup . Mr. Zelaya 's opponents say he was ousted because he was trying to illegally change the constitution to extend his term in office . Japan says it will deliver a second installment of food aid to

were discovered when a hydrogen leak led NASA to cancel a planned launch attempt in early November . NASA officials now say the shuttle could launch as early as February 24 . At this point , the Discovery supply mission is the next-to-last in the agency 's 30-year shuttle program . But another flight could be added mid-year , before the fleet is set to retire this year . Final results from last month 's presidential runoff election in Guinea-Bissau give the victory to former military ruler Joao Bernardo Vieira . Electoral officials say Mr. Vieira , also known as " Nino , " received 52 percent of the vote , compared with 48 percent for his rival , interim leader Malam Bacai Sanha . Mr. Sanha has said he will not accept the results , alleging voter fraud . Both candidates in the July 24 runoff election had pledged to end years of political instability . Guinea-Bissau has been plagued by numerous coups and coup attempts since gaining independence from Portugal in 1974 . Mr. Viera took power in a 1980 coup and ruled 19 years until he was ousted during a civil war . South Korea says it will not stage another large-scale rescue of North Korean refugees . South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young told reporters Tuesday that Seoul has no plans to repeat last July 's airlift of 468 North Korean refugees from a third country that was never officially identified but believed to be Vietnam . The mass defection angered North Korea , which responded by boycotting ministerial talks in August . Analysts say Mr. Chung 's comments may be part of efforts by South Korea to encourage North Korea to resume bilateral talks . Last month , South Korea announced it would strengthen background checks on North Koreans seeking asylum in the South , as well as cut financial subsidies to North Korean defectors . World oil prices rose Wednesday after Iran test-fired some missiles . Investors assumed the tests indicate continued tensions between Iran , a major oil producer , and Israel and the United States , which might disrupt oil supplies at a time of strong demand and tight inventories . The price of oil for future delivery rose more than two dollars to go as high as $ 138.28 a barrel in New York trading . Earlier , U.S. government energy experts said members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will have net export revenues of $ 1.2 trillion this year , nearly double the gain from 2007 . The increase is driven by record-high oil prices which hit an all time high of $ 145.85 a barrel on July 3 . The average retail price of gasoline in the United States remains at a record high of just over $ 1.08 a liter ( $ 4.11 a gallon ) . A commander of Dutch troops in southern Afghanistan says forces from the Netherlands have killed dozens of suspected Taleban fighters in recent months . In an interview published Saturday in the Netherlands ' daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad , Colonel Henk Morsink said troops in troubled Uruzgan province recently have been involved in six clashes with insurgents . He also said a senior Taleban leader is believed to be among those killed . Morsink stressed that his figures are based on estimates that can not always be verified . More Dutch troops , along with additional forces from Britain and Canada , will soon be deployed in Afghanistan 's volatile south , as NATO members increase troop levels in the country from 9000 to 16000 . A top U.S. diplomat is in Turkey for talks on the situation in neighboring Iraq as it prepares for elections January 30th . Outgoing Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage was slated to meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as well as top lawmakers and Turkey 's army chief-of-staff . Earlier Sunday , in Syria , Mr. Armitage said Damascus has improved security along its border with Iraq . But he also urged Syrian leaders to do more , and repeated U.S. claims that members of Saddam Hussein 's ousted regime are " going back and forth from Syria " into Iraq . The U.S. envoy spoke after meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . Mr. Armitage visited northern Iraq on Saturday , and will also visit Jordan before returning home early this week . South Africa has lifted a 13-year ban on killing elephants , despite an outcry from conservationists and animal rights activists . The government earlier this year authorized the move , which took effect Thursday , as a way of controlling the rising elephant population , which has more than doubled since 1995 , to 18000 . In related news , a conservation group says 14 elephants have been illegally killed during the last two weeks in the Democratic Republic of Congo 's Virunga National Park . Wildlife Direct says in a statement released Thursday that rebels , soldiers and local villagers killed the elephants . The group blames the surge in poaching on the liberalization of the ivory trade being pushed by South Africa , and the increased presence of Chinese operators in the area who feed a demand for ivory in their home country . The park was estimated to have an elephant population of 350 as of 2006 . U.S. military officials say a television cameraman killed in Iraq Monday died in a gunbattle between Marines and insurgents , contradicting an account from his news agency . Dhia Najim , an Iraqi freelance cameraman working for Reuters , was shot and killed in the town of Ramadi , west of Baghdad . U.S. military officials say Mr. Najim was hit by a bullet in the neck while taping a clash between Marines and insurgents . But Reuters says video pictures taken at the time of Mr. Najim 's death show he was shot by a sniper and that there was no fighting at the time . The press freedom group , Reporters Without Borders , has called on the Pentagon to make what it calls a proper investigation . Russia is warning it will take retaliatory steps if any country deploys weapons in space . Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov says Moscow 's position on the issue has remained unchanged for decades in that Russia remains categorically against the militarization of space . He made the comments Thursday in Kazakhstan . Last month , White House press secretary Scott McClellan said the United States is reviewing a draft updated national space policy - but that policy does not look at the weaponization of space . However , he did say that protecting U.S. space systems is something that has to be considered . The Interfax news agency also quotes Mr. Ivanov as saying Moscow is prepared to negotiate an agreement on controlling tactical nuclear weapons - but only when all countries with such weapons keep them within their own territories . The United States has such weapons in Europe . The Israeli navy has ordered a Libyan ship carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip to turn back . Officials say the ship , the Al Marwa , was carrying some 3000 tons of aid when it was stopped by the Israeli navy . Israel says there was no physical confrontation when it ordered the ship to turn around . Palestinian officials say the ship is now sailing to the Egyptian port of El-Arish . Gaza 's borders have been largely sealed by Israel and Egypt following a violent takeover by the militant Hamas last year . The blockade has been stepped up in recent weeks due to a surge in border clashes between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants . The regional government in Iraq 's Kurdish region has signed seven new foreign oil deals . The Kurdish Regional Government said in a statement on its Web site Tuesday all revenues from petroleum activities in the Kurdish region will be shared proportionately throughout Iraq under Iraqi law . The government in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq has approved its own law governing the oil industry , while the Iraqi national parliament is still working on a hydrocarbon law that would regulate the industry throughout the country . Iraqi oil minister Hussein al-Shahristani had declared as " illegal " a previous agreement between the Kurdish regional government and a foreign oil company , Hunt Oil . The Kurdish regional government said the new contracts are for the Mala Omar and Shorish Blocks , the Akre-Bijeel Block , the Shaikan Block , the Rovi and Sarta Blocks , and a block in Dihok province . Iraq 's Shi'ite politicians have postponed until Sunday a decision to select a new prime minister . The United Iraqi Alliance met Saturday , to choose between two contenders - Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari and Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi . Each is supported by two major factions in the Shi'ite alliance . But Shi'ite sources say followers of radical Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr wanted more time to discuss the candidates . Iraq 's Shi'ite alliance won the largest number of parliament seats in the nation 's December 15th election . Under Iraq 's constitution , the new parliament should convene within the next two weeks . Separately , Kuwait 's al-Rai television station says the kidnappers in Iraq of American journalist Jill Carroll are threatening to kill her if their demands are not met by February 26 . The militants previously had demanded that all Iraqi women prisoners be freed . The Sri Lankan navy says it has arrested five Indian nationals and confiscated their trawler carrying 61000 bomb detonators . A navy spokesman said the five men were detained late Wednesday off the island 's northern coast , an area under Tamil Tiger rebel control , and were handed over to police . He said authorities are trying to determine if the shipment was meant for the rebels . The seizure came hours after the government and the rebels agreed to hold a new round of peace talks in Switzerland , easing fears that the country may slide back into full-scale civil war . Meanwhile , Sri Lanka 's stock market staged a major rally Thursday as investors cheered the agreement between Colombo and the rebels . Tamil rebels also released a Sri Lankan policeman in what they call a goodwill gesture , four months after capturing him when he strayed into rebel territory . Greek officials say a moderate earthquake has struck off the coast of some of the country 's islands in the Aegean Sea . The Athens Geodynamic Institute says Friday 's magnitude 5.1 quake was centered near the eastern islands of Kos and Astypaleia , about 300 kilometers from the Greek capital . There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries . Iranian state television says the country 's Revolutionary Guards have test-fired several long-range missiles with the capability of carrying cluster bombs . The state-owned Al-Alam network says the missiles were launched Thursday from a desert site near the central Iranian town of Qom . The tests mark the beginning of a 10-day Iranian military exercise that will also include drills in the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman . The Iranian report says the missile tests involve the Shahab-3 missile , which has a range of up to 2000 kilometers . The Revolutionary Guards are the ideological wing of the Iranian armed forces , and have a separate command structure from the regular army . Iran is conducting military maneuvers after United States held naval exercises in the Persian Gulf earlier this week . The U.S.-led drills involved 25 nations and were aimed at training forces to block the transport of weapons of mass destruction . Russia is defending its plans to sell Venezuela assault rifles and helicopters . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed concerns expressed by the United States that the guns and aircraft could fall into the hands of leftist rebels in Colombia . Mr. Lavrov said the arms deal is a bilateral issue in line with international law . U.S. officials fear Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , who has strained relations with Washington , could export small arms to rebel movements , including rebel groups in neighboring Colombia . A State Department spokesman says the United States has raised the issue with Russia on several occasions . Earlier this week , Venezuelan Vice President Jose Rangel said his country is buying the weapons to strengthen its national security and that the purchase should not concern Washington . Security is tight in the Afghan capital , Kabul , on the eve of the inauguration of the country 's first parliament in more than 30 years . Police and troops were deployed days ahead of the Monday ceremony , during which 351 new lawmakers will be sworn in by President Hamid Karzai . The event will be attended by many foreign dignitaries , including U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney . Concerns that the Taleban insurgents could disrupt the opening of a landmark parliamentary session were heightened after rebels attacked a police checkpoint near Kandahar overnight , killing three policemen . A Taleban insurgent was also killed in the ambush . Meanwhile , France 's Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie , visiting Kabul on Sunday , said Paris will increase the number of its troops in Afghanistan in 2006 when NATO expands operations there . Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov says Russia will soon begin testing a new intercontinental ballistic missile system . The Russian minister told reporters his country would develop weapons based on the Topol-M mobile missiles and the sea-based Bulava system . The Interfax news agency quotes Mr. Ivanov as saying Moscow plans to produce nuclear weapons that can penetrate any defense system . Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende says a " no " vote in next week 's referendum on the European Constitution would damage the country 's reputation as a champion of European integration . In an interview with Dutch newspapers Saturday Mr. Balkenende said European leaders currently view the Netherlands as a country that works " constructively and critically " with international institutions . Reuters news agency quotes the Netherlands leader as urging voters not to use the referendum as an opportunity to express discontent with Dutch government policies , but to read the document and vote on its substance . Latest public opinion polls indicate that more than half of Dutch citizens plan to vote against the treaty in the June first referendum . Diabetics have a greater than average chance of having a heart attack or stroke . But new research indicates that lowering blood pressure and cholesterol below recommended guidelines seems to reduce these risks . VOA 's Carol Pearson tells us about the study . U.S. presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama have responded cautiously to North Korea 's declaration of its nuclear activities . Senator McCain Thursday called the declaration " a modest step forward , " but said it was only a step covering one part of North Korea 's activities . He said the expected destruction of a nuclear cooling tower Friday would be another step , but said it is important to remember that the goal is a full , permanent , and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . Senator Obama said critical questions about North Korea 's nuclear program remain unanswered . He said sanctions against the country are an important part of leverage to pressure North Korea to act . President George Bush promised to lift trade restrictions now that North Korea submitted the declaration . Sales of new homes in the United States declined 1.6 percent in May , evidence that the slump in the housing market is continuing for a second year . Tuesday 's report from the Commerce Department showed that if sales continued at May 's pace for a year , just 9,15,000 new homes would change hands . Analysts blame rising interest rates and a glut of unsold homes for the decline . Besides the housing market , consumers tell researchers they are also worried about jobs and high energy prices . A separate report by a business group showed consumer confidence declining in June ( by 4.6 points to a reading of 103.9 ) . Economists track consumer confidence for clues about the consumer spending that drives most of the U.S. economy . A U.S. federal judge has awarded more than $ 90 million in Cuban assets to the families of two men executed in Cuba in 1961 after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion attempt . The ruling Friday in the northeastern state of New York ordered a bank holding frozen Cuban assets to pay sums to the families of Howard Anderson and Thomas Ray , both Americans . Anderson was arrested and executed in Cuba for counter-revolutionary activities , while Ray 's CIA plane was shot down over Cuba . Both men were executed by the Cuban government . The families of the men sued Cuba under a U.S. federal law allowing citizens to bring lawsuits against foreign governments in cases of terrorism . The Bay of Pigs invasion was a CIA-backed attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro . Sales of previously-owned homes in the United States declined in May as higher mortgage interest rates cut demand . Tuesday 's report from a business group , the National Association of Realtors , says re-sales fell more than one percent . If home sales continued at this rate for a full year , 6.7 million homes would change hands . Tuesday 's report on existing home sales contrasts sharply with Monday 's figures on sales of newly-built homes , which increased . But analysts say new home sales are likely to decline under pressure from rising interest rates . U.S. central bankers are expected to announce another in a long series of interest rate increases later this week . A separate report said U.S. consumer confidence increased slightly this month . Consumer confidence figures give experts clues about consumer spending , which drives most U.S. economic activity . Russia 's state-owned natural gas firm Gazprom has announced plans to buy a controlling stake in the Russian daily Izvestia . A spokesman for Gazprom media says negotiations are almost complete , with an announcement in coming days . The Vedomosti business daily quotes industry officials as speculating the deal could be worth between $ 10 million to $ 20 million . Critics call the move a Kremlin effort to tighten its influence on the media . The government already controls national television and radio networks . An editor at Izvestia resigned last year in what he said was a dispute over the newspaper 's coverage of the Beslan school crisis in which more than 330 people were killed . He said he was forced to resign over coverage the paper 's leadership deemed too shocking . The newspaper printed graphic pictures of the bloody siege . Some speculated that coverage upset the Kremlin . Jennifer Lopez will come to your party - for a price . Russian banking tycoon Andrei Melnichenko is reportedly paying the singer-actress $ 2 million to perform at his wife 's 30th birthday party . International media report Lopez will receive $ 1.2 million for her 40 minute performance in the UK , with an additional $ 8,00,000 earmarked for expenses . The 35-year-old Melnichenko 's personal fortune is estimated near $ 5 billion . In other Jennifer Lopez news , the U.S. Magazine Us has named her its Style Icon of the Year ; she 'll pick up her prize at a ceremony in Hollywood . The top U.S. weapons inspector for Iraq says the search for weapons of mass destruction has " gone as far as feasible " and has found nothing . The assessment by CIA special advisor Charles Duelfer , head of the Iraq Survey Group , was contained in an addendum , posted on the Internet late Monday , to last year 's final report on Iraq 's weapons program . Mr. Duelfer concludes there is no reason to keep many detainees who are held because of their knowledge of Iraq 's weapons program , saying that after more than 18 months , the weapons investigation and debriefing of weapons-related detainees has been exhausted . The United States maintains that the Iraqi authorities will make the final decision whether to release those detainees . Mr. Duelfer also warns that there is a risk some Iraqi scientists might share their skills with terrorists or insurgents , who are making concerted efforts to gain chemical weapons capabilities . NATO has expressed its solidarity with Britain over Thursday 's deadly terrorist attacks in London . Ambassadors of the 26 alliance states , meeting in Brussels , condemned terrorism in all its forms and reaffirmed NATO 's determination to combat terrorism and defend the alliance 's values of freedom , tolerance and democracy . Earlier , NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer condemned the bombings as heinous crimes and stressed that they underscored the need for alliance unity in fighting terrorism . Spanish police have arrested seven people suspected of helping fund Islamic militants with links to the al-Qaida terrorist group . Interior Minister Jose Antonio Alonso says the seven , arrested in the Costa del Sol region of southern Spain , had provided funds and logistical support to the Algerian-based Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat . Spanish authorities have stepped up efforts against Islamic militants since last year 's al-Qaida-linked bombings of Madrid commuter trains that killed 191 people . Last month , police arrested 11 people on charges of providing financial support for the same Algerian-based group in raids in other areas of southern Spain . Two senior U.S. diplomats are meeting with the new leader of southern Sudan 's former rebel movement Wednesday in an effort to ensure that the sudden death of Vice President John Garang will not derail the peace process . The visit by Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Connie Newman and special envoy for Sudan Roger Winter follows two days of riots in response to news of the death of Mr. Garang , the former rebel leader who became Sudan 's vice president as part of a peace deal . At least 42 people died in the violence . Mr. Garang was killed in a helicopter crash Saturday evening . He was a key player in the deal that ended 21 years of civil war between rebels in southern Sudan and the Khartoum government . The U.S. diplomats plan to hold talks with government officials in Khartoum after their meetings in the south of the country . A lawyers for two British journalists being held in Zimbabwe has accused prosecutors of deliberately delaying the proceedings after state witnesses failed to turn up at court . Beatrice Mtetwa told the court in the northern town of Norton Friday that prosecutors are seeking " to prolong the accused 's agony . " The Sunday Telegraph 's chief foreign correspondent Toby Harnden and photographer Julian Simmonds have been in custody for more than a week on charges of reporting on last week 's parliamentary elections without accreditation . The journalists were granted bail last week . But the state appealed , forcing the men to remain in custody . Ms. Mtetwa said Friday 's proceedings lasted less than one hour because not all of the state 's witnesses showed up in court . Reports from Baghdad say two bombs have exploded near a market in central Baghdad , killing at least 10 people . Police say the second bomb was detonated Tuesday after a crowd had gathered at the site of the first blast , near a shop just outside the Bab al-Sharjee market . Hours earlier , two Iraqi civilians were killed and four policemen were wounded in two separate roadside bombings in southern Iraq ( at Yousifiyah , south of Baghdad , and in Basra province ) . A U.S. military announcement today says three Marines were killed Monday near the restive town of Hit in western Anbar province . A fourth Marine has died of wounds suffered in a similar attack in the same region on Sunday . The U.S. military in Iraq has sent a team of forensic experts to the northern city of Mosul to investigate the cause of Tuesday 's massive explosion at an American military base that killed 22 people and wounded 72 others . Initial reports said the base 's dining hall was struck by either a mortar or rocket . But the military says it is not ruling out anything . The militant group that claimed responsibility for the attack said it was carried out by a suicide bomber . Among the dead were 14 American military personnel , four U.S civilian contractors and four Iraqi security force members . Most of the wounded were also American servicemen . Wednesday , the streets of Mosul were deserted and the city 's five bridges were closed . American tanks and troops were positioned across the city and helicopters hovered overhead . The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has inducted its newest members at a star-studded ceremony in New York City . The 2006 class of inductees includes heavy metal band Black Sabbath , punk rockers the Sex Pistols , southern rock mainstays Lynyrd Skynyrd , and the late jazz legend Miles Davis . Members of the new wave band Blondie also were inducted into the Hall of Fame , Monday . The hall also gave a lifetime achievement award to trumpeter Herb Alpert and business partner Jerry Moss , the founders of A&M Records . Musicians become eligible for Hall of Fame consideration 25 years after their first recording . The Hall of Fame has a museum in Cleveland , Ohio to honor the history and personalities of rock music . Russia says a strain of bird flu virus found infecting fowl in Siberia is the deadly H5N1 strain that can be transmitted to humans . A spokesman for the agricultural ministry in Moscow Friday said the investigation of the bird flu outbreak in Russia 's Novosibirsk region indicated the need for wider quarantine measures . The outbreak in Siberia began earlier this month when large numbers of chicken , geese and other fowl began dying . Strains of the virus have been hitting flocks throughout Asia , and more than 50 people in southeast Asia have died from exposure to the virus since 2003 . Health experts fear a global pandemic if the virus mutates into a form easily passed among humans . Two car bomb blasts near the Shi'ite shrine city of Karbala in southern Iraq have killed at least 20 people and wounded more than 50 others . Iraqi officials say the attacks targeted Shi'ite pilgrims heading to Karbala for an important Sh'ite holiday this week . Earlier Monday , another car bomb exploded in front of the Baghdad offices of Al-Arabiya television , killing at least four people and wounding 16 others . Al-Arabiya staffers said the explosion badly damaged the building and left a huge crater . Iraqi officials had previously warned the network about the threat of an insurgent attack . Monday 's bombing was not the first time Al-Arabiya has been targeted in Iraq . The network 's Baghdad bureau chief escaped harm in 2008 after a bomb was found strapped to his car . The Arabic-language station is owned by Saudi Arabia and based in Dubai . A Jewish settler in the West Bank has been indicted by an Israeli court in the shooting deaths of four Palestinians in northern Israel earlier this month . Defendant Asher Weisgan has been in Israeli custody since allegedly opening fire on a group of Palestinian workers at an industrial zone at the West Bank settlement of Shiloh on August 17 . At the time of the assault , police said a gunman seized a rifle from an Israeli security officer at the work zone and then shot and killed two Palestinians he had driven to the job site . He then opened fire on a crowd of nearby workers , killing two more and wounding a fifth worker . Police said the attacker launched the attack to protest Israel 's recently concluded evacuation of the Gaza Strip . The leader of Germany 's Social Democratic Party says he will not run again for that post and might not serve in a new cabinet . Franz Muentefering spoke Monday after the Social Democrats ' executive committee named a left-wing party member to run for party general secretary , rejecting Mr. Muentefering 's chosen candidate . The committee nominated Andrea Nahles to run , rejecting Kajo Wasserhoevel . Mr. Muentefering was set to become vice chancellor in a government led by Christian Democrat Chancellor-designate Angela Merkel . The Social Democrats will elect their general secretary in mid-November . Iraqi Shi'ite leaders say they have made their final compromise proposal to Sunni Arabs on the text of a new constitution . A Shi'ite official said Friday the proposal addresses the two main Sunni Arab objections : federalism , and efforts to exclude former members of Saddam Hussein 's Ba'ath Party from public life . The announcement comes following a phone call from President Bush to Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim , the leader of Iraq 's largest Shi'ite party . The White House says it is doing everything it can to assist the Iraqis in moving the democratic process forward . In other developments , the U.S. military launched multiple airstrikes Friday against a building sheltering about 50 suspected terrorists in the western province of Al-Anbar , close to the Syrian border . No casualty figures were released . The Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft has rejected a statement by the giant natural gas company Gazprom about their planned merger . Wednesday , Gazprom chief Alexei Miller said the Yuganskneftegaz production unit would become an independent state company led by Rosneft head Sergei Bogdanchikov . Rosneft Thursday said the statement does not correspond with reality , and should be taken as opinion . The merger would give the state a controlling stake in Gazprom , which would allow the lifting of a ban on foreign ownership of its shares . The government had seized Yuganskneftegaz for failure to pay taxes and sold it at auction last year . Rosneft acquired the unit from a previously unknown company that purchased it at the auction . Critics accuse the Kremlin of trying to tighten control of the oil market and retaliate for former Yukos chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky 's support of the political opposition , charges authorities deny . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called for closer cooperation with Syria , as both countries face continuing diplomatic pressure from Western governments . Mr. Ahmadinejad 's comments Sunday in Tehran came in a joint news conference with visiting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . The Iranian news agency quotes Mr. Ahmadinejad as saying common threats require more bilateral cooperation to protect the Middle East from foreign aggression . Both governments remain on a U.S. list of countries supporting terrorism , and Washington accuses both countries of failing to stop Islamic insurgents from crossing their borders into Iraq . Additionally , the United States and European governments accuse Iran of seeking to build atomic weapons . Both governments deny the charges . Authorities in Angola say 14 more people have died from the Marburg virus , raising the death toll from the outbreak to 146 . This makes it the worst outbreak of the Ebola-like virus since 123 people died in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2000 . The World Health Organization has deployed 20 experts to Angola to help combat the virus , which is characterized by headaches , vomiting and diarrhea . The outbreak has been mainly confined to the northern province of Uige . Store owners in the capital city of Luanda say panicked residents have bought out all their stocks of household bleach to help guard against the virus . Ethiopia 's elections body has rejected opposition calls for a re-run of last month 's parliamentary poll , won by the ruling party in a landslide . A coalition of six parties said the May 23 election was rigged , and that voters and opposition candidates were harassed . The National Electoral Board said Wednesday that the opposition claims were not backed by any evidence . Election results showed the ruling EPRDF coalition and allied parties taking 534 out of 537 parliamentary seats . Opposition leaders say the government 's near-total victory could not be accomplished without cheating . Both the United States and the European Union criticized the election as falling short of international standards . Ethiopian officials have said the voting was free , fair , and democratic . The election was Ethiopia 's first parliamentary poll since a disputed 2005 vote that led to violent unrest . Security forces killed nearly 200 people while putting down demonstrations after that poll . Election authorities in Liberia have begun releasing returns from the country 's first post-war election , in which large numbers turned out to elect a new president and parliament . With ballots from about one percent of the polling stations counted , former World Bank economist Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has 24 percent of the vote . Soccer ( football ) star George Weah , one of her opponents in the presidential race , has 21 percent . The head of Liberia 's National Elections Commission , Frances Johnson Morris , says it could take three to seven days of vote counting before the new leader is known . United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and the U.S. ambassador to Liberia , Donald Booth , have praised Liberians for conducting a peaceful and orderly election . Liberia 's vote is seen as a step toward restoring stability to a country beset by war and corruption . The Philippines will keep its peacekeeping force in Haiti despite a sniper attack on a Filipino enlisted man Thursday . Staff Sergeant Rodrigo Galam was standing guard outside the Christopher Hotel in Port-au-Prince when he came under sniper fire .
